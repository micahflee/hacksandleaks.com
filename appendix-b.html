          <h1>Appendix B: Scraping the Web</h1>
          <p>Sometimes, in order to research important data publicly available
online, you&rsquo;ll need to download a local copy. When websites don&rsquo;t
provide this data in structured downloadable formats like spreadsheets,
JSON files, or databases, you can make your own copy using <em>web
scraping</em> (or <em>screen scraping</em>): writing code that loads web pages for
you and extracts their contents. These might include social media posts,
court documents, or any other online data. You can use web scraping to
download either full datasets or the same web page again and again on a
regular basis to see if its content changes over time.</p>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section id="content" data-content="appendix-b">
        <div class="wrapper" id="about-content"><p>For example, consider the Parler dataset discussed in Chapter 11. Before Parler was
kicked offline by its hosting provider for refusing to moderate content
that encourages and incites violence, the archivist
@donk_enby wrote code to scrape all 32TB of
videos&mdash;over a million of them&mdash;to distribute to researchers and
journalists. This appendix teaches you how to do something similar, if
the occasion arises.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll discuss legal considerations around web scraping and give a brief
overview of HTTP, the protocol that web browsers use to communicate with
websites. Finally, I describe three different techniques that allow you
to scrape different types of websites. Complete Chapters 7, 8, 9, and 11
before following along, since you&rsquo;ll need the basic knowledge of Python
programming, CSVs, HTML, and JSON covered there.</p>
<h2 id="legal-considerations">Legal Considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#legal-considerations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Web scraping isn&rsquo;t a crime, but its legality is still murky. In general,
using computer systems with permission (like visiting a public website)
is perfectly fine, but accessing them without authorization (like
logging in to someone else&rsquo;s account) is illegal hacking.</p>
<p>In the US, unauthorized access is a violation of the extremely outdated
hacking law known as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, or CFAA.
Web scraping shouldn&rsquo;t fall under unauthorized access because it entails
writing code simply to load public web pages that everyone can already
access, rather than loading those pages the normal way (using a web
browser). The problem is that scraping may violate a website&rsquo;s terms of
service, and there&rsquo;s no legal consensus on whether this could constitute
a violation of the CFAA&mdash;courts have ruled both ways.</p>
<p>Despite this, web scraping is an extremely common practice. Search
engines like Google are essentially massive web scraping operations, as
are archive sites like the Internet Archive&rsquo;s Wayback Machine at
<a href="https://web.archive.org">https://web.archive.org</a>.
Companies often use web scraping to keep track of airline ticket prices,
job listings, and other public data. It&rsquo;s also a critical tool for
investigative reporting.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>The CFAA was originally passed, at least in part, in response to the 1983 film WarGames. In the film, a teenage hacker, played by Matthew Broderick, breaks into a military supercomputer and almost starts World War III by mistake. At the time, there weren&rsquo;t any laws against hacking computers. The wildly popular film scared Congress into passing such laws.</em></p>
<p>The Markup, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates the tech industry,
summed up the case for web scraping in an article that includes several
examples of investigative journalism that relied on it. For example, the
newsroom Reveal scraped content from extremist groups on Facebook, as
well as law enforcement groups, and found significant overlap in
membership. Reuters also scraped social media and message boards and
uncovered an underground market for
adopted kids; that investigation led to a kidnapping conviction. You can

<p>Before you can start writing code to scrape the web yourself, you&rsquo;ll
need to understand what HTTP requests are.</p>
<h2 id="http-requests">HTTP Requests<a class="headerlink" href="#http-requests" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>When you load a web page, your web browser makes an <em>HTTP request</em>. You
can think of this as the browser sending a message to the website&rsquo;s
server, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to download the content for the page at this
URL so I can look at it on my computer,&rdquo; to which the server replies
with an <em>HTTP response</em> that contains the content, typically HTML code.
Your browser parses this HTML to figure out what else it needs to
download to show you the full web page: images, fonts, Cascading Style
Sheets (CSS) files that define how the web page looks, and JavaScript
files that tell the website how to act. The browser makes another HTTP
request for each of these resources, getting the content for them all.
Websites also tend to make lots of HTTP requests while you&rsquo;re using
them, such as to check for updates and display them on the page in real
time.</p>
<p>HTTP requests and responses have <em>headers</em>, or metadata about the
request or response. You might need to send specific headers for your
scraping to work properly, depending on the website you&rsquo;re trying to
scrape. You might also need your code to keep track of <em>cookies</em>, which
are required for any site with a login option. There are many types of
requests you can incorporate into your web scraping code, such as <em>POST</em>
requests, which are used to submit forms. However, the code in this
appendix will make only <em>GET</em> requests, the simplest and most common
type of request, which download the content from a URL.</p>
<p>Many sites don&rsquo;t like web scrapers for a variety of reasons, including
the fact that if a script is hammering a site with HTTP requests, this
increases the site&rsquo;s bandwidth costs and could even cause it to crash.
Sometimes sites will add roadblocks, such as limiting the number of
requests you can make in a short amount of time or requiring that the
user (or bot) fill out a CAPTCHA, in an effort to hinder or prevent
scraping.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>Some time around 2002, when I was in high school, my friends and I
decided to make a song lyrics website. Similar sites existed, but they
were incomplete. I thought it would be simple to scrape the lyrics from
those other sites and make a single site that had</em> [all]
<em>of the lyrics. I wrote a script to scrape thousands of lyrics from one
particular site, but my script crashed while it was running. I realized
it was because the source website had gone down. A few days later, the
site came back online with a message: the owner was overjoyed to learn
how much traffic the site was getting, but to keep up with it, they had
to raise money to keep the site online. I felt bad about it, and we
never ended up launching that lyrics site.</em></p>
<h2 id="scraping-techniques">Scraping Techniques<a class="headerlink" href="#scraping-techniques" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>This section describes three different techniques for web scraping, each
introducing a different Python module. You&rsquo;ll use a Python package
called HTTPX to make HTTP requests, then use another called Beautiful
Soup to help you select the data that you care about from a soup of
messy HTML code. Finally, you&rsquo;ll use a package called Selenium to write
code that launches a web browser and controls what it does.</p>
<p>Web scraping requires a lot of trial and error as well as a thorough
understanding of the layout of the website that you&rsquo;re scraping data
from. This appendix gives you just a few examples, not a comprehensive
overview, but they should give you a head start on writing your own web
scraping scripts in the future.</p>
<h3 id="loading-pages-with-httpx">Loading Pages with HTTPX<a class="headerlink" href="#loading-pages-with-httpx" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>HTTPX is a third-party Python package that lets you make your own HTTP
requests with Python. In this section, you&rsquo;ll learn how to use it to
scrape the most recent posts from any given user on the far-right social
media site Gab, which you read about in Chapters 1, 12, and 13.</p>
<p>Install the <code>httpx</code> module
with pip by running <code>python3 -m pip install httpx</code>. After importing <code>httpx</code> into your code, you should be able to
load a web page by running the <code>httpx.get()</code> function and passing in a URL. This
function returns a request object, and you can access the request&rsquo;s
content with <code>.content</code> for
binary data or <code>.text</code> for
text data. For example, Listing B-1 shows Python code to make an HTTP
request to
<em>https://example.com</em>
and view its content.</p>

<p><em>Listing B-1: Scraping the HTML from https://example.com</em></p>
<p>First, this code imports the <code>httpx</code> module. It then calls the
<code>httpx.get()</code> function,
passing in a URL as an argument, and saves the response in the variable
<code>r</code>. Finally, it displays the
<code>r.text</code> variable, which is
all of the HTML code that makes up
<em>https://example.com</em>.
(If you&rsquo;re loading a binary file, like an image, then you can get the
binary data in the <code>r.content</code>
variable.) This simple <code>httpx.get()</code> function is often all you need to
scrape entire databases of information from the web. The script I&rsquo;ll
show you in this section that scrapes posts from Gab relies on this
function.</p>
<p>Since web scraping means writing code that loads URLs, your first step
should be to determine which URLs you need to load. The easiest way to
do this is to use the built-in developer tools in your web browser. You
can open them in most browsers by pressing the F12 key. In both Firefox
and Chrome, you can see the HTTP requests your browser is making, and
what the responses look like, in the Network tab of the developer tools.
For example, if you open your browser&rsquo;s developer tools and load the
profile page of a Gab user, you can see what HTTP requests it makes to
gather that user&rsquo;s most recent posts. Once you have that information,
you can write a script that makes the same HTTP requests for you.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>The developer tools built in to Firefox, Chrome, and other browsers are a great way to learn what data your web browser is sending back and forth on the websites you&rsquo;re visiting, to see exactly how web pages are laid out, and more. For more about Firefox&rsquo;s developer tools, see <a href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/index.html">https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/index.html</a>; for Chrome, see <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools">https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools</a>.</em></p>
<p>For example, the Gab page for Marjorie Taylor Greene, the US
congressperson who&rsquo;s also a Christian nationalist and QAnon conspiracy
theorist, is located at
<a href="https://gab.com/RealMarjorieGreene">https://gab.com/RealMarjorieGreene</a>.
In a web browser, load that URL and then open the developer tools.
Refresh the page to get all of the HTTP requests to show up in the
Network tab.</p>
<p>In the Network tab, you should see several HTTP requests listed on the
left half of the developer tools panel. When you click a request, the
right half of the panel displays information about it. The right half
has its own tabs that you can switch through to see details like the
request&rsquo;s headers, cookies, and the body of the request and its
response.</p>
<p>When I loaded this page and looked through my browser&rsquo;s HTTP requests
and their responses, I decided I was most interested in the following
URLs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>https://gab.com/api/v1/account_by_username/RealMarjorieGreene</strong> The
response to this request includes a JSON object containing information
about Greene&rsquo;s Gab profile, including her Gab account ID, 3155503.</p>
<p><strong>https://gab.com/api/v1/accounts/3155503/statuses?sort_by=newest</strong> The
response to this request includes a JSON array of Greene&rsquo;s most recent
Gab posts. Her account ID is in the URL itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first URL let me look up the Gab ID of any account, and the second
URL let me look up the recent posts from an account, based on its Gab
ID. Figure B-1 shows Firefox&rsquo;s developer
tools in action while loading this page.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure B-1: Viewing the JSON response to a specific request in the Firefox developer tools Network tab" src="media/images/FigureB-1.png" /><br />
<em>Figure B-1: Viewing the JSON response to a specific request in the Firefox developer tools Network tab</em></p>
<p>As you can see, this response is in JSON format. I wanted to write a
script that, given a Gab username, would download the latest posts from
that user. In order to write it, I had to spend some time looking at the
JSON in these responses to understand how it was structured and what
information I was interested in. For example, since I wanted to start
with a Gab username, my script would first need to load the URL
<em>https://gab.com/api/v1/account_by_username/&lt;username&gt;</em>,
replacing <em>&lt;username&gt;</em> with my target username. It would then need to
parse the JSON it receives to extract this Gab user&rsquo;s ID. Then, using
that ID, it would need to load the URL
<em>https://gab.com/api/v1/accounts/&lt;id&gt;/statuses?sort_by=newest</em>,
replacing <em>&lt;id&gt;</em> with the Gab ID of the target account. Finally, it
would need to parse that JSON response to display the latest Gab posts.</p>
<p>Based on this research, I wrote the following script to scrape the
latest posts from any target Gab account. Here&rsquo;s the code for this web
scraping script,
<em>httpx-example.py</em>:</p>

<p>This script first imports the <code>httpx</code> module, since it will need that module
to make HTTP requests. Like many Python scripts throughout this book, it
uses the <code>click</code> module to
accept CLI arguments. In this case, it accepts an argument called
<code>gab_username</code>, the username
of the target Gab user ❶.</p>
<p>When the <code>main()</code> function
runs, it downloads information about the target user by calling the
<code>httpx.get()</code> function and
passing in the URL
<em>https://gab.com/api/v1/account_by_username/&lt;gab_username&gt;</em>,
replacing <em>&lt;gab_username&gt;</em> with the value of the CLI argument and
storing the result in the variable <code>r</code> ❷. As my browser&rsquo;s developer tools made clear,
the response should be a JSON object, so the script next calls
<code>r.json()</code> on it to make HTTPX
convert it into a dictionary called <code>user_info</code>. It then checks to see if
<code>user_info</code> has an
<code>error</code> key; if so, it
displays the error message and quits early. If you try loading that URL
with an invalid username, you&rsquo;ll see the error message in the
<code>error</code> key: the string
<code>Record not found</code>.</p>
<p>Once the script has successfully retrieved information about a Gab user,
it displays some of that information&mdash;the display name, number of
followers, number of follows, and number of posts&mdash;in the terminal
❸. The script then uses
HTTPX to make another HTTP request, this time to load the user&rsquo;s posts.
Note that this URL includes <code>user_info['id']</code>, which is the ID of the user
discovered from the previous HTTP request ❹. As before, it calls <code>r.json()</code> to convert the JSON into a Python
object, this time a list called <code>posts</code>. In the following <code>for</code> loop, the script loops through the
list of posts, displaying them one at a time.</p>
<p>You can find a complete copy of this code in the book&rsquo;s GitHub repo at
<a href="https://github.com/micahflee/hacks-leaks-and-revelations/blob/main/appendix-b/httpx-example.py">https://github.com/micahflee/hacks-leaks-and-revelations/blob/main/appendix-b/httpx-example.py</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, I could use this script
to download the recent posts of any Gab user by including their username
as an argument. For example, here&rsquo;s what it looked like when I ran this
script on the account of Andrew Torba, Gab&rsquo;s founder and owner and the
author of the book <em>Christian Nationalism</em>, whose Gab username is <code>a</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>micah@trapdoor appendix-b % python3 httpx-example.py a
Display name: Andrew Torba
3,803,381 followers, 2,662 following, 67,317 posts

2022-12-07T04:56:56.989Z: Is it really so crazy to think that I care nothing
at all about a particular historical atrocity that happened on another
continent 80 years ago when there is a genocide of babies happening right
here, right now, today?
repost @ScipioAmericanus: 2022-12-07T04:50:37.560Z: Jews literally believe
that they can reject God because they&#39;re justified according to the flesh and
their own laws. Wicked stuff.
--snip--
</code></pre></div>

<p>The output shows Torba&rsquo;s display name, statistics about his account, and
several of his latest posts to Gab. As you can see, they&rsquo;re on the
fascist side. Torba has 3.8 million followers, because every Gab user
automatically follows him when they create an account.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>While 3.8 million followers sounds like a lot, most of those accounts
aren&rsquo;t active. In 2021, I analyzed hacked Gab data and discovered that
of the roughly 4 million accounts, only 1.5 million of them had posted
any content at all, only 400,000 had posted more than 10 times, and only
100,000 of those had posted anything recently. You can read my analysis
at <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/15/gab-hack-donald-trump-parler-extremists/">https://theintercept.com/2021/03/15/gab-hack-donald-trump-parler-extremists/</a>.</em></p>
<p>Try running <em>httpx-example.py</em> on any Gab account you&rsquo;d like. Unless Gab&rsquo;s website has changed, this
should download the recent posts from that user. However, it&rsquo;s possible
that by the time you run this script, the site may have changed so that
the script doesn&rsquo;t work anymore. This is the unfortunate nature of web
scraping. Every script you write that scrapes the web relies on websites
acting one specific way; if they don&rsquo;t, your script might break. It&rsquo;s
often a simple matter to update a script so it works again, though. To
do so, you&rsquo;d need to use your browser&rsquo;s developer tools to figure out
how the website changed, and then update your script to match its new
URLs and behavior&mdash;basically, repeat what you just did. In the worst
case, if the website has changed a lot, you may need to rewrite your
scraping script from scratch.</p>
<p>Using Python logic and HTTPX, you can also modify the script to get
<em>all</em> of the posts for a given account, rather than just the recent
ones. You could write a script that finds a target Gab user and
downloads the list of accounts they follow. Or you can take a target Gab
post and download a list of accounts that liked it. You&rsquo;d just need to
learn exactly which HTTP requests to make to get the information you&rsquo;re
interested in, and then have Python make those requests for you. Some of
these tasks would be more complicated than others&mdash;for example, to get
the data you&rsquo;re looking for, you may need to create a Gab account and
have your scraper make requests while you&rsquo;re logged in. The more web
scraping scripts like these you write, the better at it you&rsquo;ll get.</p>
<p>To learn more about using the HTTPX package, check out its documentation
at <a href="https://www.python-httpx.org">https://www.python-httpx.org</a>.</p>
<h3 id="parsing-html-with-beautiful-soup">Parsing HTML with Beautiful Soup<a class="headerlink" href="#parsing-html-with-beautiful-soup" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Scraping Gab was simple because the responses to the HTTP requests were
in JSON format, but pulling specific information out of the HTML in a
web page is more challenging. The easiest way to parse HTML in Python is
to use a package aptly called Beautiful Soup (BS4 for short). Install
the <code>bs4</code> module by running
<code>python3 -m pip install bs4</code>.</p>
<p>For example, here&rsquo;s some code that uses the <code>httpx</code> module to download the HTML from
<em>https://example.com</em>, like you did in the last section:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="kn">import</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">httpx</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">bs4</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">BeautifulSoup</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">r</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">httpx</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;https://example.com&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This code imports the <code>httpx</code>
module, then imports Beautiful Soup from the <code>bs4</code> module. Next, it uses
<code>httpx.get()</code> to make an HTTP
request to
<em>https://example.com</em>
and stores the result in <code>r</code>,
allowing you to access the HTML string itself using the <code>r.text</code> variable. As you saw in Listing B-1,
this HTTP response is in HTML format and includes the page&rsquo;s title
inside the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag, as
well as two paragraphs of text within <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags inside the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<p>Using BS4, you can parse this HTML to select specific pieces of
content&mdash;in this case, the page title and the content of the first
paragraph:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">soup</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">BeautifulSoup</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">r</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">text</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;html.parser&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>This code parses the HTML string (<code>r.text</code>) using BS4, storing the resulting
<code>BeautifulSoup</code> object in the
<code>soup</code> variable defined in the
first line of code. This allows you to use <code>soup</code> to extract whatever information you&rsquo;re
interested in from the HTML. The code then displays the page title by
printing the value of <code>soup.title.text</code>.</p>
<p>Next, the script searches for the first paragraph on the HTML page and
displays its text by printing the value of <code>paragraph.text</code>. Finally, it finds all of the links on
the page (which are <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>
tags), loops through them in a <code>for</code> loop, and
prints the URL for each link (the URL is defined in the <code>href</code> attribute of <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags). The
<em>https://example.com</em>
web page has only one link, so the code displays just that.</p>
<p>For practice, next we&rsquo;ll explore a script that scrapes content from
Hacker News
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">https://news.ycombinator.com</a>),
a news aggregator site about tech startups and computer science. Hacker
News is similar to Reddit in that anyone can post links, and users then
upvote and downvote those links, with the most popular ones rising to
the top. Its web design is simple and has remained the same for many
years, making it a good choice for web scraping practice.</p>
<p>Your practice script will download the title and URL from the first five
pages of popular links. The front page of Hacker News displays the 30
most popular recent posts. If you scroll to the bottom and click More,
you&rsquo;ll see the second page of results, showing the next 30 most popular
recent posts, at the <em>https://news.ycombinator.com/?p=2</em> URL. Likewise, the third page of results has the URL <em>https://news.ycombinator.com/?p=3</em>, and so on.</p>
<p>Figure B-2 shows a Firefox window with Hacker
News loaded and the developer tools open. This time, I&rsquo;ve switched to
the Inspector tab, which allows you to inspect how the HTML of the page
is laid out. The Inspector tab shows all of the HTML tags that make up
the page, and when you mouse over an individual tag, your browser
highlights the corresponding design element on the web page. In this
example, I moused over an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag, and the browser highlighted that
element.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure B-2: Using Firefox’s developer tools to inspect the HTML that makes up a Hacker News post" src="media/images/FigureB-2.png" /><br />
<em>Figure B-2: Using Firefox’s developer tools to inspect the HTML that makes up a Hacker News post</em></p>
<p>The developer tools show that all posts in the
Hacker News site are laid out in an HTML table. In HTML, tables are
defined within <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tags.
Each row is a <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> tag, and
each cell within it has a <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> tag. Here&rsquo;s the HTML code from a
typical Hacker News post:</p>

<p>The rows with <code>class="athing"</code>, or the value of the attribute

users have posted. Inside each <code>athing</code> row, there are three cells (that is,
three <code>&lt;``td&gt;</code> tags). The last of these cells
contains the actual link, the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.</p>

<p>First, the script imports the <code>csv</code>, <code>time</code>, <code>httpx</code>, and <code>bs4</code> modules. In the <code>main()</code> function, it opens a new CSV for
writing called <em>output.csv</em>, creates a <code>csv.DictWriter()</code> object, and uses that object to write
the CSV headers (<code>Title</code> and
<code>URL</code>, in this case), as you
learned in Chapter 9.</p>
<p>The following <code>for</code> loop loops
through the results of <code>range(1, 6)</code>, saving each item as <code>page</code>. The <code>range()</code> function is useful for looping through
a list of numbers; in this case, it starts with 1, then 2, and so on
until it hits 6 and then stops, meaning it returns the numbers 1 through
5. The code displays the page number that it&rsquo;s about to load, then makes
the HTTP request to load that page using <code>httpx.get()</code>, creating a different URL for the
current page on each loop. After making each HTTP request that gets a
page of results, the code parses all of the HTML from that page using
BS4, storing it as <code>soup</code>.</p>
<p>Now things get slightly trickier. As noted earlier, all of the HTML
table rows that have the class <code>athing</code> contain links that users posted. The
script gets a list of all of these rows by calling
<code>soup.find_all("tr", class_="athing")</code>. The <code>find_all()</code> method searches the BS4 object
<code>soup</code> for all instances of
the HTML tag <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> and
returns a list of matches. In this case, the code also includes
<code>class_="athing"</code>, which tells
BS4 to include only tags that have the <code>class</code> attribute set to <code>athing</code>. The <code>for</code> loop loops through them, saving each
item in the <code>table_row</code>
variable.</p>
<p>Now that the code is looping through each table row that contains a link
posted by a user, it goes on to find that link tag. There are several
links in each table row, so it figures out which one is the link a user
posted. First, it calls <code>table_row.find_all("td")</code> to get a list of all of the table
cells inside <code>table_row</code>,
storing that list in <code>table_cells</code>. As noted earlier, the last cell
contains the link that we care about. Therefore, the code pulls out just
the last cell in this list, storing it in the variable
<code>last_cell</code> (the <code>−1</code> index is the last item in a list). The
code searches just <code>last_cell</code>
for the link it contains (the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag), and uses <code>print()</code> to display the link&rsquo;s title and URL.
Finally, it calls <code>writer.writerow()</code> to also save this row into the CSV.</p>
<p>The code does this once for each of the page&rsquo;s 30 rows. It then waits
one second, using <code>time.sleep(1)</code>, and moves on to the next page, until
it has extracted all the links from the first five pages. When the
script is finished running, it creates a file called <em>output.csv</em> that
should contain the 150 most recent popular links posted to Hacker News.
Most of the time when you&rsquo;re scraping
real data for an investigation, you&rsquo;ll save it to a CSV spreadsheet,
like this script did, or to a SQL database (as discussed in Chapter 12) so that you can work with it later.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>The <code>find_all()</code> method in this code passes an argument called <code>class_</code> instead of <code>class</code>. This is because <code>class</code> is a Python keyword and can&rsquo;t be used as a variable name. If you want to use
<code>find_all()</code> to select tags using any other attribute, then the argument name will be the same as the attribute name. For example, <code>soup.find _all("a", href="https://example.com")</code> will find all link tags in
<code>soup</code> that have an href attribute set to <code>https://example.com.</code></em></p>
<p>You can also find a copy of this code in the book&rsquo;s GitHub repo at

<p>Try running it yourself now. Assuming Hacker News hasn&rsquo;t updated its web
design, it should work fine; however, the URLs will differ because the
most popular recent links on Hacker News are constantly changing.</p>
<p>This script scrapes only the first five pages of content on Hacker News.
In theory, you could scrape <em>all</em> the content on the site since its
founding in 2007. To do so, you&rsquo;d have to modify the script to stop not
after page 5 but when it gets to the very last page, presumably one that
doesn&rsquo;t have any links on it. This assumes that the site will actually
show you content that old and that you could make those millions of HTTP
requests without it blocking your IP address. I don&rsquo;t know if this is
true or not with Hacker News&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t attempted to scrape everything
from this site myself.</p>
<p>I mentioned in the HTTP Requests section that some websites
add roadblocks to make scraping more difficult, and this turned out to
be true with Hacker News. When I first wrote this script, it didn&rsquo;t
include the <code>time .sleep(1)</code>
code, which waits one second between each HTTP request. I found that
Hacker News limits how quickly you can make HTTP requests, and the fifth
request in quick succession responded with an HTML page with the error
message
<code>Sorry, we're not able to serve your requests this quickly</code>. I solved
this problem by waiting one second between HTTP requests. It&rsquo;s common to
run into hurdles like this while you&rsquo;re writing scrapers, but it&rsquo;s also
often a simple matter of modifying your script like this to get around
these roadblocks.</p>

<h4 id="bs4-web-scraping-for-travel">BS4 WEB SCRAPING FOR TRAVEL<a class="headerlink" href="#bs4-web-scraping-for-travel" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>In 2014, shortly after Edward Snowden leaked his massive dataset of top-secret NSA documents to Laura Poitras and Glenn Greenwald, I scheduled a trip to Rio de Janeiro, where Greenwald lived, to help him with computer security and to look through the Snowden docs myself. (This was several years before Greenwald unfortunately became a far-right pundit who openly supports the American fascist movement.) At the time, Americans could travel to Brazil only if they had a visa, and they needed to visit a consulate in person to get one. However, the San Francisco consulate’s website told me that all appointments were booked for the next two months.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, I wrote a simple Python script that scraped the consulate’s availability calendar web page, using BS4 to loop through each cell in the calendar and see if any appointment slots were open. If it found an opening, my script would send me a text message. I then configured a VPS to run this script every 10 minutes so I’d be the first to know if someone canceled their appointment. In less than two days, I got a text, snagged an appointment, and got my visa. I flew to Rio a few days later.</p>

<h3 id="automating-web-browsers-with-selenium">Automating Web Browsers with Selenium<a class="headerlink" href="#automating-web-browsers-with-selenium" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes scraping websites is too challenging for Beautiful Soup alone.
This is often the case with sites that are JavaScript-heavy, where
viewing the HTML source doesn&rsquo;t result in much information you&rsquo;re
interested in. This is true for sites like Facebook, YouTube, and Google
Maps. It&rsquo;s much simpler to get information from this sort of site by
using a web browser than by untangling the complicated web of HTTP
requests that you&rsquo;d need to make to get the same information. Some
websites also put up barriers to scraping. They might add JavaScript
code that ensures visitors are using real web browsers before showing
them content, preventing users from just making HTTP requests using cURL
(discussed in Chapter 4) or a Python package
like HTTPX.</p>
<p>You can control a real web browser for scraping purposes by using
software called Selenium. Scripts that just make HTTP requests are more
efficient and run much quicker than using Selenium because they don&rsquo;t
require running a whole web browser and downloading all of the resources
of the target website. When I&rsquo;m writing a
scraper, I generally start by attempting to scrape the site using HTTPX,
but if this technique turns out to be too complicated, I switch to
Selenium.</p>
<p>To use the Selenium Python package, you must also install a <em>web
driver</em>, software that Selenium uses to control a web browser. Selenium
supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. The example in this section
uses the Firefox driver, which is called geckodriver.</p>
<p>To continue, follow the instructions for your operating system, then
skip to the Testing Selenium in the Python Interpreter section.</p>

<p>For this task, Windows users should work with native Windows tools

<p>Also make sure you have Firefox installed (see <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/</a>).</p>
<p>To install geckodriver, go to <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases">https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases</a>. You&rsquo;ll see several ZIP files for the latest version of geckodriver that
you can download. Download the appropriate Windows version and unzip it.
You should end up with a single file called <em>geckodriver.exe</em>. In File
Explorer, copy this file and paste it into <em>C:\Windows\System32</em>. This
will allow you to run geckodriver from PowerShell no matter what your
working directory is.</p>

<p>Now that you have Selenium and geckodriver installed, test them out in
the Python interpreter by loading this book&rsquo;s git repo website on GitHub
to get a feel for how Selenium allows you to control a web browser:</p>

<p>This code first imports <code>webdriver</code> from the <code>selenium</code> module. It then creates a new Firefox
driver by calling <code>webdriver.Firefox()</code> and saves it in the variable
<code>driver</code>. When you create the
Selenium driver, a new Firefox window should open on your computer, and
a robot icon should appear in the address bar&mdash;this is how you know
that this browser is being controlled by Selenium.</p>
<p>The code then instructs the browser to load the URL
<a href="https://github.com/micahflee/hacks-leaks-and-revelations">https://github.com/micahflee/hacks-leaks-and-revelations</a>.
After running the command, you should see Firefox load that GitHub page.
Once the page is loaded, including all of its JavaScript or other
complicated components, you can write code to control it. In this case,
the code just displays the title of the page in the terminal with
<code>print(driver.title)</code>.
Finally, it quits Firefox.</p>
<h4 id="automating-screenshots-with-selenium">Automating Screenshots with Selenium<a class="headerlink" href="#automating-screenshots-with-selenium" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s try something slightly more complicated. In this section,
we&rsquo;ll go over a script that will take two arguments: a location name and
the filename of a screenshot to save. Using Selenium, the script will
load Google Maps at <a href="https://maps.google.com">https://maps.google.com</a>,
search for the location, zoom in a little, turn on the satellite images
layer, and take a screenshot of the satellite image of the location,
saving it to disk.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m programming web scrapers, I find it helpful to have an
interactive Python interpreter open in a terminal where I can test out
Selenium or BS4 commands, allowing me to see if they work in real time
without having to start my script over. When I&rsquo;m writing a Selenium
script, I open developer tools inside the browser I&rsquo;m driving to inspect
all of the HTML tags, which helps me figure out which commands to run.
Once I get something working, I copy the working code into the script
that I&rsquo;m writing in my text editor.</p>
<p>For example, to search for the location in Google Maps, I needed to make
the Selenium browser select the search box, type the location, and press <strong>ENTER</strong>. In HTML, tags often have <code>id</code> attributes. By using the
Firefox developer tools, I discovered that the search box in Google
Maps, which is an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>
tag, includes the <code>id="searchboxinput"</code> attribute, meaning the search box has
an <code>id</code> of
<code>searchboxinput</code>. That allowed
me to enter code into the Python interpreter that would select the
search box, type a search query into it, and press <strong>ENTER</strong> in
the browser it was controlling. I didn&rsquo;t always get it right on the
first try, but after some trial and error, I wrote some working code. At
this point, I added that code to my script.</p>
<p>I also used developer tools to figure out how to turn on the satellite
image layer. In the bottom-left corner of Google Maps is an icon called
the <em>minimap</em> that lets you toggle different layers on and off. The
developer tools showed me that this icon had an <code>id</code> of <code>minimap</code> and that I could click one of the
buttons in the minimap element to turn on the satellite layer; just like
with the search box, I tested clicking this icon in the Python
interpreter until I got it working.</p>
<p>The following script, <em>selenium-example.py,</em> uses Selenium to take
satellite image screenshots from Google Maps for you:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>First, the script imports the <code>click</code> and <code>time</code> modules and then several components
from the <code>selenium</code> module.
Specifically, it imports <code>webdriver</code>, the component required to actually
launch and control a web browser. It also imports <code>Keys</code> and <code>By</code> to automate pressing <strong>ENTER</strong>
after searching and to search for HTML elements by their <code>id</code> attribute.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>Exactly what you need to import from <code>selenium</code> depends on what you&rsquo;re trying
to do. Consult the Selenium for Python documentation to learn exactly
what you need and when&mdash;that&rsquo;s how I figured it out.</em></p>
<p>The code includes Click decorators before the <code>main()</code> function, making this a command line
program that takes two arguments, <code>location</code> and <code>screenshot_filename</code>. The <code>location</code> variable is a Google Maps search
query, like <em>Manhattan, NY</em> or <em>The Great Pyramid of Giza</em>, and
<code>screenshot_filename</code> is the
path to save the final screenshot.</p>
<p>When the <code>main()</code> function
runs, the code starts by creating a Selenium web driver, which should
open a Firefox window that the script will then control. The
<code>driver.implicitly_wait(10)</code>
function tells Selenium to wait up to 10 seconds for page elements to
load. The code loads <a href="https://maps.google.com">https://maps.google.com</a> in Firefox with the <code>driver.get()</code> function, then finds the search box
element on the page, storing it in the variable <code>search_box</code>. It finds the search box by running
<code>driver.find_element(By.ID, "searchboxinput")</code>. Once the code has this search box
object stored in <code>search_box</code>,
it clears any text in the text box by calling the <code>clear()</code> method on it, and then it types the
text in the <code>location</code> string
by calling <code>send_keys(location)</code>. Finally, it presses <strong>ENTER</strong>
to search for this location by calling <code>send_keys(Keys.RETURN)</code>. At this point, Google Maps should
search for the location.</p>
<p>The code then zooms in by selecting the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag, the main HTML tag that contains
all other tags, then telling Firefox to press the + key twice, which is
the Google Maps keyboard shortcut to zoom in.</p>
<p>At this point, Firefox has loaded Google Maps, searched for a location,
and zoomed in on that location. The code then turns on the satellite
image layer by locating the minimap in the corner of the screen. Once it
finds this, it locates all of the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> tags inside the minimap by calling the
<code>find_elements(By.TAG_NAME, "button")</code> method, and then it clicks the third
button, calling the <code>click()</code>
method on the third element (which has an index of <code>2</code>) on the list of buttons. This turns on
the satellite images layer.</p>
<p>Finally, the script waits two seconds, just to make sure the satellite
images have finished loading, and then saves a screenshot of the web
page to <code>screenshot_filename</code>.
When it&rsquo;s done, it quits Firefox.</p>
<p>You can find a complete copy of this code in the book&rsquo;s GitHub repo at
<a href="https://github.com/micahflee/hacks-leaks-and-revelations/blob/main/appendix-b/selenium-example.py">https://github.com/micahflee/hacks-leaks-and-revelations/blob/main/appendix-b/selenium-example.py</a>.</p>
<p>You can use <em>selenium-example.py</em> to generate Google Maps screenshots of
any location you like. For example, I ran the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>python3<span class="w"> </span>selenium-example.py<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;great pyramid of giza&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span>giza.png
</code></pre></div>

<p>This opened a Firefox window that was controlled by Selenium. It loaded Google Maps, searched for <em>great
pyramid of giza</em>, zoomed in, turned on the satellite images layer, and
saved a screenshot of the window in the file <em>giza.png</em>. Figure
B-3 shows <em>giza.png</em>, scraped from Google
Maps.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure B-3: A satellite image of the Great Pyramid of Giza from Selenium" src="media/images/FigureB-3.png" /><br />
<em>Figure B-3: A satellite image of the Great Pyramid of Giza from Selenium</em></p>
<p>On your own, it might also be fun to try searching for <em>US Capitol</em>;
<em>Washington, DC</em>; <em>Kremlin, Moscow</em>; or <em>Tokyo, Japan</em>.</p>
<p>This example script used Selenium to take screenshots. You could modify
it so that Selenium automatically takes a screenshot each time a public
figure posts to social media, so you&rsquo;ll have a record of it in case they
delete it. You&rsquo;re not limited to cataloging information in this way,
though; you can also use Selenium to extract information from web pages
and store them in CSV spreadsheets or any other format you&rsquo;d like, just
like you can with BS4.</p>

<p>In this appendix, I&rsquo;ve gone over a few techniques for web scraping and
provided some simple example scripts to show off the basics of how they
work. However, in order to write code for your future web scraping
projects, you&rsquo;ll probably need to learn more about web development than
is covered in this book, depending on what site you&rsquo;re trying to scrape.
For example, your HTTPX and BS4 scraper
might need to first log in to a website and then make all of its future
requests as that logged-in user in order to access the content you&rsquo;re
after. This would require making HTTP POST requests instead of just GET
requests and keeping track of cookies, neither of which I&rsquo;ve covered
here.</p>
<p>As a next step, I recommend getting more comfortable with the developer
tools built into browsers. This will help familiarize you with the HTTP
requests your browser makes and what their responses include. Spend more
time browsing the layout of HTML elements, as you did in this appendix.
The more you learn about web development, including more complex topics
like HTTP headers and cookies, the easier it will be for you to scrape
the web. If you can access information in a web browser, you can write a
script that automates accessing that information.</p>
