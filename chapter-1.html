<p>Most aren’t very aware of it, but we’re all under surveillance. Telecom companies and tech giants have access to a massive amount of private data about everyone who uses phones and the internet, from our exact physical locations at any given time to the content of our text messages and emails, and they can share this data with leak investigators.</p>

        <div class="wrapper trunc" id="about-content"><p>Even when our private data doesn’t get sent directly to tech companies, our devices still record our every move locally. Can you name every single web page you visited last month? Your web browser probably can, and so can web trackers that follow your activity across the internet.</p>
<p>In addition to the constant background surveillance that everyone faces, workers with access to sensitive datasets are often under even stricter corporate or government surveillance. Their work computers and phones come preinstalled with spyware that monitors everything the employees do. Database systems keep track of exactly who searches for exactly which search terms and when, and which documents they open, download, or print.</p>
<p>It’s in this environment that ordinary people find themselves becoming sources. Through the course of their work they witness something unethical or disturbing. They might make a folder with incriminating documents, or take some screenshots of the company chat, or do some searches on internal databases to learn more and make sure their suspicions are correct. They might email themselves some documents, or copy files to a USB stick that they plug into their work computer. They might text their friends or family for advice while thinking about what to do next. Most sources aren’t aware of the massive digital trail that they’ve already left by the time they reach out to a journalist or regulator.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you’ll learn about protecting sources and securing the datasets you obtain from them. I’ll go over the editorial and ethical considerations involved in redacting documents and deciding what information to publish, as well as where you should store datasets based on how sensitive they are. I’ll show how to verify that datasets are authentic, describing how I’ve done so in the past for hacked data from COVID-19 pandemic profiteers and chat logs from WikiLeaks. Verifying authenticity of datasets is not only important to writing accurate stories, it’s also critical to protecting your own reputation as a journalist. Finally, you’ll learn to use password managers and disk encryption and protect yourself from malicious documents.</p>
<h3 id="safely-communicating-with-sources">Safely Communicating with Sources</h3>
<p>Because everything we do leaves a data trail, protecting sources is fraught. After you publish a blockbuster report based on information you’ve obtained from an anonymous whistleblower, you should expect the target of your investigation to launch an investigation of their own into your source’s identity. The balance of power between a confidential source and the leak investigators on their trail is extremely asymmetric. If you’re a journalist or researcher trying to protect your source, even doing all the right things perfectly isn’t always enough. Because so much of source protection is outside your control, it’s important to focus on the handful of things that are in your control.</p>
<p>In this section, I’ll describe which sources face risks and which don’t, as well as strategies for reducing that risk. I’ll also discuss the differences between working with confidential sources who have legitimate access to inside information and hackers who break the law to obtain information. It’s important for you to carefully consider how your own choices as an investigator could impact your source, preferably before you even begin speaking with one.</p>
<h3 id="working-with-public-data">Working with Public Data</h3>
<p>Some datasets don’t have any risk to the source at all. When the government publishes a set of documents in response to a public records request, or is made public as part of a lawsuit, you can include as much of the data as you like in your report. This data might contain revelations that powerful people don’t want anyone to know, but you won’t put anyone at risk of retaliation when you bring attention to them, since the data is already public.
Similarly, you don’t need to worry about source protection for datasets that may contain sensitive data but are public and widely available, such as the BlueLeaks dataset you’ll download in Chapter 2. Any information you discover from that dataset has already been scoured by the FBI investigators trying to determine who the hacker was. In these cases, you don’t need to worry about how many people had access to the documents. There’s no chance of accidentally burning your source by giving too many details to a government or corporate media office when you ask if the data is real and if they have a statement. Since the dataset is already public, any damage to the source has already been done.</p>
<p>That said, if you’re dealing with a dataset from a confidential source—that is, a source that faces retaliation like getting fired, arrested, or even murdered if their identity is revealed—here’s what you need to keep in mind.</p>
<h3 id="minimizing-your-digital-trail">Minimizing Your Digital Trail</h3>
<p>Leave as small of a digital trail as you can when communicating with your source. Speak with them remotely as little as possible; that is, avoid talking over email, SMS messages, phone calls, direct messages in social media apps, and so on. Don’t follow your confidential source on social media, and they shouldn’t follow you. If you do have to send messages or make calls, use an encrypted messaging app like Signal, which I’ll cover in Chapter 2, and make sure your source deletes the records of their chats with you. You’ll often need to record what your source told you in order to report on it, but you should take steps to protect these records, such as removing them from messaging apps on your phone and keeping them locally on your computer rather than in a cloud service. If you no longer need your own records of conversations after you’ve published your report, such as for potential follow-up stories, delete them.</p>
<p>Make sure your source knows not to search the internet for you or for the reports that you publish in a way that could be associated with them. Google search history has been used as evidence against sources in the past. For example, in 2018, Treasury Department whistleblower Natalie Mayflower Sours Edwards was indicted for allegedly providing a secret dataset to BuzzFeed journalist Jason Leopold. The documents she was accused of leaking detailed suspicious financial transactions involving Republican Party operatives, senior members of Donald Trump’s 2020 election campaign, and a Kremlin-connected Russian agent and Russian oligarchs. During the leak investigation, the FBI got a search warrant to access her internet search history, and her indictment accused her of searching for multiple articles based on the contents of her alleged leaks shortly after they were published.</p>
<h3 id="verifying-data">Verifying Data</h3>
<p>As a journalist or researcher, verifying that data you’ve obtained is authentic is one of your core responsibilities. The simplest way to authenticate documents is to ask the company or government that produced them if they’re real, but this is fraught with risk to your source. In some cases, you don’t want to give up any details that might reveal your source’s identity. I go into detail about ways to avoid this in the “Authenticating Datasets” section on page XX. You also might not want to even reveal that specific documents have been leaked. You’ll learn more about this in the “Redaction” section on page XX.</p>
<h3 id="working-with-hackers-and-whistleblowers">Working with Hackers and Whistleblowers</h3>
<p>The steps you must take to protect your source vary greatly depending on their technical sophistication. Not all sources are whistleblowers, people with inside access to datasets or documents who leak evidence of wrongdoing for ethical reasons. Sometimes your source may be a hacktivist who wants to bring down companies or government agencies that they find unjust.</p>
<p>Unlike most whistleblowers, hackers tend to understand that they’re under surveillance and that everything they do leaves a digital trail, so they usually take countermeasures to hide their tracks. It’s common for whistleblowers to reveal their identities to journalists for verification reasons, even if they aren’t publicly named, but hackers typically remain fully anonymous. However, hackers can often provide you with technical information you can use to independently authenticate a dataset using open source intelligence, which I describe in the “Authenticating Datasets” section on page XXX. As with any source, you can’t necessarily trust what hackers tell you, but their expertise can help you independently verify that the data they sent you is authentic. Because of all this, there’s often less risk to your source when publishing documents from hackers than from whistleblowers.</p>
<p>When communicating with a hacker source, it’s important that you stick to your role as a journalist or researcher. In the US, you’re not breaking any laws just by speaking with a source who’s a hacker, but your source is almost certainly breaking laws by hacking into companies or governments and stealing data. Don’t do anything that could be construed as conspiring with them. For example, don’t ask them to get specific data for you—let them give you whatever data they choose. If you’re a journalist working with an established newsroom, you might fare better against legal threats than a freelancer would. While everyone should be protected equally under the law, newsrooms often have resources like lawyers and money that they’ll use to defend you. When you’re not sure if something you’re doing could get you in trouble, consult a lawyer.</p>
<p>Sometimes sources pretend to be hacktivists or whistleblowers but are actually state-sponsored hackers. For instance, Russian military hackers posed as hacktivists when they compromised the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016, interfering with the US election by sending hacked datasets to WikiLeaks. This sort of dataset might be authentic and newsworthy, but you don’t want to end up being a pawn in someone else’s information warfare. If you’re unsure about your source’s credibility or believe that they might have ulterior motives—or if you’re confident that they’re being dishonest with you—it’s important to mention your skepticism about your source, and why you have doubts, in your reporting. WikiLeaks did the opposite: It insisted its source wasn’t Russian intelligence when it knew otherwise, and it even spread the conspiracy theory that Seth Rich, a Democratic Party employee who was murdered, was the group’s real source, leading to years of harassment against Rich’s family members.</p>
