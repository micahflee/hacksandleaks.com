          <h1>Chapter 10: BlueLeaks Explorer</h1>
          <p>In some ways, I spent the summer of 2020 like many other Americans. I
mostly stayed at home, avoiding COVID-19 like the plague it is; I spent
far too many hours doom-scrolling through social media feeds; and
occasionally I put on an N95 mask, grabbed some hand sanitizer, and hit
the streets to protest the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna
Taylor, and countless other Black Americans. But I also spent much of
that summer writing code that would make it easier for me and other
journalists at The Intercept to make sense of the sprawling BlueLeaks
dataset.</p>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section id="content" data-content="chapter-10">
        <div class="wrapper" id="about-content"><p>My efforts culminated in a piece of open source software, which I
released as part of this book, called BlueLeaks Explorer. BlueLeaks
Explorer is a web application that allows you to examine the BlueLeaks
data almost as if you could log in as an admin on the actual websites
that were hacked. BlueLeaks Explorer is
a little like a large Python script that makes all of the CSVs in
BlueLeaks easier to work with, like the scripts you wrote in Chapter
9.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you&rsquo;ll continue to investigate the BlueLeaks dataset,
this time using BlueLeaks Explorer. I&rsquo;ll give you a thorough overview of
the software, including how to set it up on your own computer and how to
start researching BlueLeaks with it. I&rsquo;ll conclude the chapter by
explaining the technology behind the app and pointing you to its Python
source code on GitHub. If you ever need to develop an app to investigate
a specific dataset, you can use this chapter as inspiration.</p>
<h3 id="undiscovered-revelations-in-blueleaks">Undiscovered Revelations in BlueLeaks<a class="headerlink" href="#undiscovered-revelations-in-blueleaks" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>As discussed in the previous chapter, my BlueLeaks investigation focused
on the data from the <em>ncric</em> folder. Even within that folder, I
concentrated on the final two weeks of data, focusing on police
surveillance of the Black Lives Matter movement. Other journalists dug
into different parts of the dataset, investigating fusion centers in
places like Maine and Texas.</p>
<p>Notably, journalist Nathan Bernard broke several stories for the local
news-and-arts magazine <em>Mainer</em> based on BlueLeaks documents from the
Maine Information and Analysis Center (MIAC), Maine&rsquo;s fusion center.
These included stories about MIAC disseminating unverified rumors,
sometimes based on satirical social media posts, that were first spread
by far-right activists on social media and then included in FBI and DHS
intelligence reports, similar to the FBI warning discussed in Chapter
9 about a George Soros−funded group
hiring &ldquo;professional anarchists.&rdquo; &ldquo;This bogus intel gives cops a
dangerously distorted sense of what to expect during demonstrations by
portraying peaceful protesters as highly trained, paid and organized
criminal actors intent on causing mayhem,&rdquo; Bernard wrote in one article.</p>
<p>Additionally, John Anderson and Brant Bingamon wrote a series of
articles for the <em>Austin Chronicle</em>, a local paper in Austin, Texas,
based on BlueLeaks documents from the Austin Regional Intelligence
Center (ARIC), Austin&rsquo;s fusion center. Anderson wrote about ARIC&rsquo;s
practice of monitoring for and distributing lists of local Black Lives
Matter protests (just like NCRIC did during the summer of 2020) and
about several SARs posted to ARIC, including one where the &ldquo;suspicious
activity&rdquo; was someone mailing a package of toys to Lebanon. Bingamon
wrote stories revealing that ARIC had monitored local leftist groups in
Austin, and that some ARIC courses for law enforcement teach junk
science&mdash;including a technique for detecting deception called
Scientific Content Analysis (SCAN), which a 2016 study concluded has &ldquo;no
empirical support&rdquo;
(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4766305/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4766305/</a>).</p>
<p>MIAC, ARIC, and NCRIC are some of the BlueLeaks sites that have received
the most interest, but many more haven&rsquo;t gotten any attention at all. By
the end of this chapter, you&rsquo;ll have all the tools you need to do a deep
dive on any BlueLeaks folder you choose and search for newsworthy
revelations. To start, you&rsquo;ll install BlueLeaks Explorer in Exercise
10-1.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-10-1-install-blueleaks-explorer">Exercise 10-1: Install BlueLeaks Explorer<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-10-1-install-blueleaks-explorer" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>You can find BlueLeaks Explorer&rsquo;s source code at
<a href="https://github.com/micahflee/blueleaks-explorer">https://github.com/micahflee/blueleaks-explorer</a>.
That GitHub page includes instructions on how to get it up and running
locally on your computer, but I&rsquo;ll explain all the steps in this
exercise as well.</p>
<p>The BlueLeaks Explorer app is packaged as a Docker image and published
to Docker Hub at
<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/micahflee/blueleaks-explorer">https://hub.docker.com/r/micahflee/blueleaks-explorer</a>.
You&rsquo;ll run it locally on your computer using Docker and point it at your
BlueLeaks folder. Before you begin, make sure you&rsquo;ve completed the
exercises in Chapter 5 so that you
understand how to use Docker and Docker Compose.</p>
<h4 id="create-the-docker-compose-configuration-file">Create the Docker Compose Configuration File<a class="headerlink" href="#create-the-docker-compose-configuration-file" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Start by creating a new folder called <em>blueleaks-explorer</em>. This folder
will require about 5GB of disk space. Create a new file in that folder
called <em>docker-compose.yaml</em> and open it in your text editor.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>If you&rsquo;re using Windows, I recommend that you follow this chapter in Ubuntu with WSL rather than PowerShell (see Appendix A for information about performance issues you might encounter when using Docker in Windows). You can open an Ubuntu terminal, create the <code>blueleaks-explorer</code> folder in your Linux filesystem using <code>mkdir blueleaks-explorer</code>, and edit the <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> file in VS Code by running <code>code docker-compose.yaml</code>, all from Ubuntu.</em></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how I created the folder and made the <em>docker-compose.yaml</em> file
on my Mac. You can do the same in Linux or Windows with WSL:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>micah@trapdoor ~ % mkdir blueleaks-explorer
micah@trapdoor ~ % cd ~/blueleaks-explorer
micah@trapdoor blueleaks-explorer % code docker-compose.yaml
</code></pre></div>

<p>Add the following code to your <em>docker-compose.yaml</em> file, replacing
<code>/Volumes/datasets/BlueLeaks-extracted</code> with the path that maps to
<em>/data /blueleaks</em> in your own <em>BlueLeaks-extracted</em> folder:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">version</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;3.9&quot;</span>
<span class="nt">services</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nt">app</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">image</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">micahflee/blueleaks-explorer:latest</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">ports</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">      </span><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;8000:80&quot;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">volumes</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">      </span><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">/Volumes/datasets/BlueLeaks-extracted:/data/blueleaks</span>
<span class="w">      </span><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">./databases:/data/databases</span>
<span class="w">      </span><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">./structures:/data/structures</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This file describes the settings for the BlueLeaks Explorer Docker
container. The container is called <code>app</code> and is set to use the latest version
of the <code>micahflee/blueleaks-explorer</code> Docker container image, which you&rsquo;ll
download from Docker Hub. The <code>ports</code> section maps port 8000 on your
computer to port 80 inside the container. This means that once the
BlueLeaks Explorer app is running, you can load it on your browser at
<em>http://localhost:8000</em>. The
<code>volumes</code> section maps folders
on your machine to folders inside the container.</p>
<p>Save the <em>docker-compose.yaml</em> file.</p>
<h4 id="bring-up-the-containers">Bring Up the Containers<a class="headerlink" href="#bring-up-the-containers" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>In a terminal window, change to the <em>blueleaks-explorer</em> folder that you
just made, then run this command to download the BlueLeaks Explorer
Docker image and start the server:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>docker-compose<span class="w"> </span>up
</code></pre></div>

<p>The first time you run the command, the output should end with something
like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>blueleaks-explorer-app-1  |  * Serving Flask app &#39;app&#39;
blueleaks-explorer-app-1  |  * Debug mode: off
blueleaks-explorer-app-1  |    WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use
                              it in a production deployment. Use a production
                              WSGI server instead.

blueleaks-explorer-app-1  |  * Running on http://172.19.0.2:80
blueleaks-explorer-app-1  |  Press CTRL+C to quit
</code></pre></div>

<p>At this point, BlueLeaks Explorer is running on your computer, but it
hasn&rsquo;t been initialized. If you load
<em>http://localhost:8000</em> in your browser,
you should get an error telling you as much.</p>
<h4 id="initialize-the-databases">Initialize the Databases<a class="headerlink" href="#initialize-the-databases" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The first time you use BlueLeaks Explorer, you must run a script to
convert the many CSV files in BlueLeaks into SQLite databases. SQLite is
lightweight SQL database software that can store a whole database in a
single file (you&rsquo;ll learn more about SQL databases in Chapter
12. All of the CSVs in BlueLeaks were
originally formatted as SQL tables, which the hacker exported into CSV
format. Converting these CSV files back into database tables makes it
easier for the Python code that runs BlueLeaks Explorer to query for and
access items within those tables, then display them in the web app. For
example, when searching for SARs that contain a specific string,
BlueLeaks Explorer might search all the BriefSummary fields in the SARs
table, trying to find reports that mention that string.</p>
<p>To initialize BlueLeaks Explorer, open a separate terminal window,
change to your <em>blueleaks-explorer</em> folder, and run this command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>docker-compose<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">exec</span><span class="w"> </span>app<span class="w"> </span>poetry<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="w"> </span>python<span class="w"> </span>./initialize.py
</code></pre></div>

<p>This will run
<code>poetry run python ./initialize.py</code> in your already running <code>app</code> container. The <em>initialize.py</em> Python
script will take a while to finish running, since it&rsquo;s transforming
thousands of CSV files into hundreds of SQLite databases; it took my
computer about 50 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>If you&rsquo;re curious about the details of what the initialization script is doing, take a look at the source code. BlueLeaks Explorer is open source, meaning you can check out the `initialize.py`` file in the project&rsquo;s git repository at <a href="https://github.com/micahflee/blueleaks-explorer/blob/main/src/initialize.py">https://github.com/micahflee/blueleaks-explorer/blob/main/src/initialize.py</a>.</em></p>
<p>When <em>initialize.py</em> finishes running, refresh
<em>http://localhost:8000</em> in your web browser
to pull up BlueLeaks Explorer, as shown in Figure
10-1.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 10-1: The freshly installed BlueLeaks Explorer app" src="media/images/Figure10-1.png" /><br />

<p>Each fusion center is unique: it&rsquo;s run by different people, has
different priorities and goals, and keeps track of different data. To
make the best use of BlueLeaks Explorer, you need to spend some time
understanding how the data in your target fusion center is laid out. I
call this layout the <em>structure</em> of a BlueLeaks site. This refers to
which tables contain useful information (some tables are empty or
contain irrelevant data about the website layout), which columns in
those tables are useful, and how the various tables are related.</p>
<p>The top of every page in BlueLeaks Explorer includes three links, as
shown in Figure 10-1: Explore Data, Define
Structure, and Browse Files. It would be difficult to automatically
figure out the structure of a BlueLeaks site, in part because it&rsquo;s
subjective&mdash;individual users determine what information is interesting
or useless for their purposes. Therefore, the Define Structure page
brings you to an editor where you can define your own structures for
BlueLeaks sites. Under Explore Data, you can find structures you&rsquo;ve
already created for individual BlueLeaks sites. Since you&rsquo;re running
BlueLeaks Explorer locally on your own computer, you&rsquo;ll have access only
to structures you&rsquo;ve made yourself or that are included in the BlueLeaks
Explorer Docker image. Finally, Browse Files lists all of the files in
BlueLeaks, enabling you to link to specific documents or embed images;
it&rsquo;s simply a web interface to the raw BlueLeaks data, as if you were
looking at it in a file browser.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>If you set up a VPN to hide your IP address from fusion center websites
as described in &ldquo;Covering Your Tracks with a VPN Service&rdquo; in Chapter
9, you may want to use a VPN for this chapter as well.
Though BlueLeaks Explorer is hosted on your own computer, viewing
content within it might load images from fusion center sites, and
clicking links could bring you to those sites.</em></p>
<p>In the following section, you&rsquo;ll begin by exploring the data for the
NCRIC site using a structure that I&rsquo;ve already created.</p>
<h3 id="the-structure-of-ncric">The Structure of NCRIC<a class="headerlink" href="#the-structure-of-ncric" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>BlueLeaks Explorer allows you to browse and search all of the tables in
any BlueLeaks site that you have a structure for. To demonstrate the
features of the app&mdash;including listing the tables in a BlueLeaks site,
viewing and searching the data in those tables, viewing data from
related tables, and viewing images and documents associated with rows of
data&mdash;you&rsquo;ll start by exploring the NCRIC data. This will help you
understand how structures are constructed before you make your own.</p>
<h4 id="exploring-tables-and-relationships">Exploring Tables and Relationships<a class="headerlink" href="#exploring-tables-and-relationships" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>As directed in Exercise 10-1, make sure your BlueLeaks Explorer Docker
container is running and load
<em>http://localhost:8000</em> in your browser.
From the Explore Data section, click <strong>Northern California Regional
Intelligence Center</strong>. Figure 10-2 shows
this page.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 10-2: Viewing the NCRIC tables in BlueLeaks Explorer" src="media/images/Figure10-2.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 10-2: Viewing the NCRIC tables in BlueLeaks Explorer</em></p>
<p>Here, you can see a list of tables in the
<em>ncric</em> folder, as well as the number of rows of data in each table. The
EmailBuilder table has 5,213 rows, for example. I&rsquo;ve hidden all of the
tables that are empty or contain information I considered irrelevant so
that they don&rsquo;t show up here.</p>
<p>When I first defined the NCRIC structure, I started by exploring the
data in each table, one at a time (I&rsquo;ll explain how you can do this for
other parts of BlueLeaks later in the chapter). I found that the
following tables contained the most interesting and potentially
newsworthy data:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>EmailBuilder</strong> Contains all of the bulk email NCRIC sends out to its large list of local police and private industry partners</p>
<p><strong>EventBuilder</strong> Describes events that NCRIC put on, complete with their descriptions, PDF flyers, and lists of who attended</p>
<p><strong>FormBuilder</strong> Contains a list of forms on NCRIC&rsquo;s website for a variety of purposes, like submitting SARs, requesting technical help, or even registering for an account with the fusion center</p>
<p><strong>Requests</strong> Includes requests from local police for the fusion center&rsquo;s assistance with tasks like monitoring social media and breaking into locked phones</p>
<p><strong>SARs</strong> Contains suspicious activity reports, which, as you learned in the previous chapter, are files submitted to NCRIC in which people report behavior that they believe could be criminal or otherwise suspicious</p>
<p><strong>SurveyForm</strong> Includes surveys that NCRIC requests from attendees of events it has hosted</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Different tables within BlueLeaks relate to each other in various ways.
For example, as you know from the previous chapter, many of the
BlueLeaks sites include the tables Documents and DocumentCategory. Both
of these tables contain a field called DocumentCategoryID. One row in
the Documents table in the <em>ncric</em> folder, for instance, describes a
document titled <em>FBI NSIR Tradecraft Alert Voter Suppression</em>. The
DocFilename field contains the path of a PDF. The DocumentCategoryID is
167. Looking at the row with that DocumentCategoryID in the
DocumentCategory table, you can see that the CategoryName is Elections.
Now you know that NCRIC put this document in the Elections category. In
database-speak, two tables that are connected via a shared field have a
<em>relationship</em>. The SurveyForm table, which lists surveys for attendees
of NCRIC-hosted events to fill out, is also related to the Survey table,
which includes the actual survey feedback.</p>
<p>BlueLeaks Explorer makes it easy to quickly find related information
within a BlueLeaks site. Click the Documents table from the list of
tables shown in Figure 10-2. You should see
a list of documents, each on its own row in the Documents table. In the
Search field, enter <strong>Voter Suppression</strong> to bring up the FBI NSIR
Tradecraft Alert Voter Suppression document, shown in Figure
10-3.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 10-3: Viewing the FBI NSIR Tradecraft Alert Voter Suppression document in BlueLeaks Explorer" src="media/images/Figure10-3.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 10-3: Viewing the FBI NSIR Tradecraft Alert Voter Suppression document in BlueLeaks Explorer</em></p>
<p>When you view a document row using the NCRIC structure I defined,
BlueLeaks Explorer will show you a link to the file itself&mdash;in this
case, a PDF. It also shows a preview of the file if it&rsquo;s available (the
path to the preview image is listed in the PreviewImage field), along
with the document category&mdash;in this case, Elections.</p>
<p>If you click the filename link, the PDF will open. Dated October 16,
2018, the document warns, &ldquo;The FBI assesses threat actors may use social
media, namely Facebook and Twitter, to suppress voter turnout by posting
disinformation on when and how to vote in the 2018 midterm election.&rdquo; It
points out examples of voter suppression tactics on social media from
the 2016 election, such as a Spanish-language meme claiming that you can
vote for Hillary Clinton by texting &ldquo;Hillary&rdquo; to a specific phone
number&mdash;tricking voters into falsely believing they voted for Clinton.</p>
<p>Next, click <strong>Permalink</strong> under the Elections category to get to the
category itself. Your URL should now be
<em>http://localhost:8000/ncric/DocumentCategory/167</em>,
and from here you should see all 11 documents
categorized in Elections. You can click Permalink under any of those
documents to view it. You can easily flip between documents and their
categories in this way because I defined a relationship in the NCRIC
structure between the Document and DocumentCategory tables. The
permalink brings you to a unique URL just for that row. During an
investigation, you can keep track of any interesting items in the
dataset using their permalinks so you can easily refer back to them
later on. The Show All link will show all of the hidden fields for this
row. I&rsquo;ve configured the Documents table to show only a handful of
fields: DocTitle, DateEntered, DocFilename, URL, PreviewImage, and the
DocumentCategory relationship. Clicking Show All will show you the
remaining hidden fields as well.</p>
<h4 id="searching-for-keywords">Searching for Keywords<a class="headerlink" href="#searching-for-keywords" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>For a concrete example of how BlueLeaks Explorer makes it easier to
investigate the BlueLeaks documents, let&rsquo;s revisit the SAR described in
Investigating a SAR in Chapter 9
in which a lawyer reported a student protester. This time, instead of
manually grepping CSV files and copying and pasting big blocks of text
from fields in spreadsheets for easier reading, you&rsquo;ll do it all in
BlueLeaks Explorer.</p>
<p>Go back to the NCRIC list of tables, click <strong>SARs</strong>, and search for
<strong>antifa</strong> to find that specific row. Figure
10-4 shows the record. The File1 row should
display a clickable link to the PDF originally attached to the SAR,
allowing you to quickly open the document. If you click it, you&rsquo;ll
immediately be able to read the PDF in another browser tab.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 10-4: Viewing a SAR in BlueLeaks Explorer" src="media/images/Figure10-4.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 10-4: Viewing a SAR in BlueLeaks Explorer</em></p>
<p>Now that you have an idea of how to navigate
BlueLeaks Explorer, it&rsquo;s your turn to explore other parts of the
BlueLeaks dataset beyond NCRIC.</p>
<h3 id="building-your-own-blueleaks-structure">Building Your Own BlueLeaks Structure<a class="headerlink" href="#building-your-own-blueleaks-structure" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In this section, you&rsquo;ll learn how to define your own structure for
another BlueLeaks site, the Los Angeles Joint Regional Intelligence
Center (JRIC). By the end of this section, you&rsquo;ll have the tools you
need to create structures for all of the BlueLeaks sites.</p>
<p>Building out a BlueLeaks Explorer site structure takes work, but it also
helps you gain a much clearer understanding of the data. Once you&rsquo;ve
started cleaning up a few of the tables, you can spend time reading
them, looking for newsworthy revelations. As you read, you&rsquo;ll probably
end up tweaking the structure to help you in your research, and you&rsquo;ll
also likely start cleaning up new tables as you discover relationships
to them.</p>
<h4 id="defining-the-jric-structure">Defining the JRIC Structure<a class="headerlink" href="#defining-the-jric-structure" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Some structures, like the one I constructed for NCRIC, are already
included with BlueLeaks Explorer. To either edit existing structures or
define new ones, load BlueLeaks Explorer in your browser and click
<strong>Define Structure</strong> at the top of the screen. Figure
10-5 shows the page that should pop up.</p>
<p>On the Define Structure page, every structure that is already defined is
listed under Edit Structures. In Figure
10-5, this is just a single structure, NCRIC.
To edit a structure, simply click its name. The BlueLeaks sites that
don&rsquo;t yet have a structure are listed by their folder name under Define
a New Structure, along with a button to create that new structure.
Scroll down until you see the listing for <em>jric</em>, and click <strong>Create</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 10-5: Viewing the Define Structure page in BlueLeaks Explorer" src="media/images/Figure10-5.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 10-5: Viewing the Define Structure page in BlueLeaks Explorer</em></p>
<p>In the page that opens, you can configure
exactly how BlueLeaks Explorer should work when you investigate the JRIC
data, as shown in Figure 10-6. The top of
the page displays the name of the site, which defaults to the BlueLeaks
folder name, <em>jric</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 10-6: Editing the JRIC structure in BlueLeaks Explorer" src="media/images/Figure10-6.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 10-6: Editing the JRIC structure in BlueLeaks Explorer</em></p>
<p>Click <strong>Rename</strong> next to the site name and enter <strong>Los Angeles Joint
Regional Intelligence Center</strong>. Every time you make a change like this,
you should see the message &ldquo;You have unsaved changes,&rdquo; with a Save
button, in the bottom-right corner. Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p>Below the site name, the Edit Structure page lists all of the tables in
this BlueLeaks site. Next to each table name is the Rename button, as
well as buttons to show or hide the table. BlueLeaks Explorer
automatically detects tables that don&rsquo;t have any rows and hides them by
default; this is why the ASIOptions table starts out hidden. You can
also manually hide tables that you don&rsquo;t care about to reduce clutter
when you&rsquo;re actually investigating this site later on.</p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve created the JRIC structure, open the <strong>Explore Data</strong>
link at the top in a separate browser tab. You should see that the Los
Angeles Joint Regional Intelligence Center site has
been added to the list of sites to explore. Figure
10-7 shows the new Explore Data page.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 10-7: The Explore Data page after you’ve created the JRIC structure" src="media/images/Figure10-7.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 10-7: The Explore Data page after you’ve created the JRIC structure</em></p>
<p>Any additional structures you create for other BlueLeaks sites will also
appear on this page.</p>
<p>Click the JRIC link to pull up all the tables in this site. As you work
through the rest of the section, and when building a structure in
BlueLeaks Explorer in general, keep two tabs open: the Explore Data and
Define Structure pages. This way, when you save changes in the Define
Structure tab, you can refresh the Explore Data tab to see them
implemented.</p>
<h4 id="showing-useful-fields">Showing Useful Fields<a class="headerlink" href="#showing-useful-fields" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>In Exercise 9-3, you wrote a Python script to automatically create a
spreadsheet mapping the names of BlueLeaks folders to their associated
organizations. You found this information in <em>Company.csv</em>, a
spreadsheet with 108 different columns. Only a few fields in this
spreadsheet proved to be relevant, which makes this a good table for
practicing showing only useful fields.</p>
<p>In your Explore Data tab, click the Company table. You should see the
page shown in Figure 10-8. There are 7 rows
displayed, each containing all 108 different fields, some of which
include lots of HTML. Because each row has so many fields, this figure
shows only the fields at the beginning of the first row of data.</p>
<p>The text in these fields isn&rsquo;t very readable yet, but that&rsquo;s easy to
fix. Back in your Define Structure tab, scroll down until you find the
Company table. For each field, you can choose the type from a drop-down
menu and toggle a checkbox to set whether or not you want it to appear
in the Explore Data page. For example, you probably don&rsquo;t care about the
value of BannerAdHeight, so you&rsquo;d want to hide that field.</p>
<p>You can also click the checkbox next to Show at the top of the table to
toggle all the checkboxes at once. Click it now to uncheck&mdash;that is,
hide&mdash;all of the fields in the Company table. From here, you can scroll
through and select only the most useful fields to display.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 10-8: Exploring data in JRIC’s Company table before editing the structure" src="media/images/Figure10-8.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 10-8: Exploring data in JRIC’s Company table before editing the structure</em></p>
<p>By reading through the Explore Data page, I can guess that the most
useful fields include URL, InitialPage, SiteHeader, and CompanyName.
Back on the Define Structure page, check the boxes next to these fields
to show them and then click <strong>Save</strong>. Refresh the Explore Data page. It
should now look like Figure 10-9.</p>
<p>The Explore Data page still lists all seven rows in the Company table,
but this time it shows only the four specific fields you selected, which
makes it much easier to read through. As you can see from the second row
of data, the Explore Data page also hides empty fields&mdash;the
leads.jric.org row doesn&rsquo;t have anything in its SiteHeader field, so
BlueLeaks Explorer skips that field.</p>
<p>You can still see all of the hidden fields for any row by clicking the
Show All button below it. In the course of an investigation, you might
discover that a field you chose to hide is actually useful, in which
case you can edit the structure again to display it.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 10-9: Viewing JRIC’s Company table with the irrelevant fields hidden" src="media/images/Figure10-9.png" /><br />

<h4 id="changing-field-types">Changing Field Types<a class="headerlink" href="#changing-field-types" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The Explore Data page is much more readable now, but it&rsquo;s still not
perfect. The SiteHeader field is hard to read because it&rsquo;s a block of
HTML. It would also be nice if CompanyName appeared at the top of the
list of fields. Let&rsquo;s make one more change to fix that.</p>
<p>Every field in BlueLeaks Explorer starts out as text, and it&rsquo;s up to you
to change the type if you think there&rsquo;s a better way to display that
field. Here are all of the types that are available:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>text</strong> Displays the value as text; this is the default for all fields</p>
<p><strong>html</strong> Renders the value as an HTML web page</p>
<p><strong>pre</strong> Displays the field&rsquo;s value as text in a fixed-width font and preserves all of the original spacing (see the BriefSummary field in Figure 10-4 for an example)</p>
<p><strong>image</strong> Loads an image from a path directly in your browser; choose this type only if the field contains a path to an image (see the PreviewImage field in Figure 10-3 for an example)</p>
<p><strong>attachment</strong> Displays a filepath as a text link directly to the file; choose this type only if the field contains a path to a non-image file (see the DocFilename field in Figure 10-3 for an example)</p>
<p><strong>survey</strong> Recognizes the format of SurveyData fields, which appear only in Survey tables and contain feedback from attendees of events hosted by fusion centers&mdash;and makes the results easier to read</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Back in the Edit Structure tab, find the SiteHeader field. This field
has a Type drop-down menu that&rsquo;s currently set to text; switch it to
<strong>html</strong>. Now scroll down until you find the CompanyName field. Click
the grip icon to the left of it and drag it to the top of the list of
fields. Click <strong>Save</strong> again and refresh the Explore Data tab. Your
Company table should now look like Figure
10-10.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 10-10: Exploring JRIC’s Company table after editing its structure" src="media/images/Figure10-10.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 10-10: Exploring JRIC’s Company table after editing its structure</em></p>
<p>Because you changed the SiteHeader field type from text to HTML,
BlueLeaks Explorer renders it as HTML and loads the JRIC header
image hosted from JRIC&rsquo;s web server. Figure
10-10 also shows that the CompanyName field
is now listed first for each row.</p>
<h4 id="adding-jrics-leads-table">Adding JRIC’s Leads Table<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-jrics-leads-table" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>In your Explore Data tab, go back to the JRIC table listing. This time,
click the Leads table. If you read through its rows, you&rsquo;ll see that
this table is full of SARs. It&rsquo;s similar to NCRIC&rsquo;s SARs table, except
that its leads are submitted by both the fusion center&rsquo;s partners and
members of the public, and it appears to retain data forever, whereas
the NCRIC SARs table includes only one month&rsquo;s worth of SARs. To get
more practice using BlueLeaks Explorer, including setting up a
relationship between two tables, you&rsquo;ll define the structure for the
Leads table next.</p>
<p>In your Define Structure tab, find the Leads table, hide all of its
columns, and repeat the steps you followed with the Company table to
show only the useful fields, selecting the most appropriate type for
each. After reading through the first several rows of Leads data in the
Explore Data tab, I decided to show FormTimeStamp, County, PhoneNum,
EmailAddress, ActivityDate, ActivityTime, ActivityDetails, fullname,
Information, NSFormName, FUpload, and FUploadName. Feel free to show or
hide different fields yourself.</p>
<p>After saving the structure and refreshing the Explore Data page, I get
these fields from the first row in the Leads table:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>FormTimeStamp</strong> 06/07/20 00:39:09</p>
<p><strong>County</strong> Los Angeles</p>
<p><strong>PhoneNum</strong> <em>[redacted]</em></p>
<p><strong>EmailAddress</strong> <em>[redacted]</em>@torrenceca.gov</p>
<p><strong>ActivityDate</strong> 06/06/20 00:00:00</p>
<p><strong>ActivityTime</strong> 1345</p>
<p><strong>ActivityDetails</strong> On the above date and time officers were dispatched
to a call of a suspicious package. Upon, arrival [<em>sic</em>] officers
noticed that the package had bottles with a cloth items [<em>sic</em>]
sticking out of the top of the bottle resembling a Molotov Cocktail.
This package was in the general area of a BLM protest that was going on.
(see attached report and photos)</p>
<p><strong>NSFormName</strong> PublicCountyLeadSheet</p>
<p><strong>FUpload</strong> LFU00010\984.docx</p>
<p><strong>FUploadName</strong> 200020437.docx</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The FUpload and FUploadName fields both contain filenames. Notice that
FUpload seems to be the path to a file inside the BlueLeaks dataset.
Back in the Define Structure page, change the type of FUpload from text
to attachment, save your changes, and refresh the Explore Data page. The
FUpload field should now link to
<em>http://localhost:8000/blueleaks-data/jric/files/LFU00010/984.docx</em>,
which loads the document from your local copy of the
data. You can click this link to read it if
you&rsquo;re curious. The filename is <em>984.docx</em>, but it appears that the
person who submitted this lead originally uploaded the file as
<em>2000020437.docx</em>.</p>
<p>Looking through other rows in this Leads table, I also notice that
values in the NSFormName field are different for different leads. My
guess is that this field describes which form was filled out to add this
lead to JRIC&rsquo;s database. Most of the values for NSFormName appear to be
PublicCountyLeadSheet or LeadSheetPrivateSectorAndPublic. Is the Leads
table related to some other table that describes forms? Let&rsquo;s find out.</p>
<h4 id="building-a-relationship">Building a Relationship<a class="headerlink" href="#building-a-relationship" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Go back to the page listing all of the tables in JRIC and click the
table named FormBuilder. This table doesn&rsquo;t have a field called
NSFormName, but it does have one called FormName. If you search the
table for PublicCountyLeadSheet and LeadSheetPrivateSectorAndPublic, you
will see that the row with ID 1 has a FormName value of PublicCounty
LeadSheet, and the row with ID 2 has a FormName value of LeadSheet
PrivateSectorAndPublic. (From the FormBuilder table page, you could sort
it by FormBuilderID ascending to see these first two rows in that table
as well.) Because the NSFormName field on the Leads table maps to the
FormName field on the FormBuilder table, there&rsquo;s a relationship between
these two tables. Let&rsquo;s create that relation in BlueLeaks Explorer.</p>
<p>Back in the Define Structure page, scroll down to the bottom of the
Leads table. After the list of fields, there&rsquo;s another section that says
Field Maps to Table. Both Field and Table are drop-down menus. Click the
Field drop-down menu to list all of the fields in this table and select
<strong>NSFormName</strong>. Click the Table drop-down menu, which lists all of the
other tables in this BlueLeaks site, and choose <strong>FormBuilder</strong>. Once
you select the table, you should see a third drop-down menu that lets
you choose the field in that table. Choose <strong>FormName</strong> and click
<strong>Create Relationship</strong>. A prompt should pop up, asking, &ldquo;What is the
name of this relationship?&rdquo; Enter <strong>Form</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>, then save
your changes.</p>
<p>Back in the Explore Data tab, navigate back to the Leads table. For each
lead, you should now see all of the fields from the form that was used
to submit the lead. However, as Figure
10-11 shows, it&rsquo;s difficult to read.</p>
<p>As you can see, the related form is displayed, but, like the Company
table you worked with previously, far too many fields are shown,
including blocks of HTML that are difficult to make sense of. To fix
this, you&rsquo;ll edit the structure of the FormBuilder table as you did with
the Company and Leads tables. As you build structures, I recommend
finishing one table so that it displays nicely, then moving on to
related ones.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 10-11: An item in the JRIC Leads table, now with a relationship to the FormBuilder table" src="media/images/Figure10-11.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 10-11: An item in the JRIC Leads table, now with a relationship to the FormBuilder table</em></p>
<p>Go back to the Define Structure tab, find the FormBuilder table, and
hide all of its fields. Check the boxes to show FormName and
FormContent, and change FormContent&rsquo;s type from text to <strong>html</strong>. You
already added a relationship to the Leads table that links it to the
FormBuilder table, so while you&rsquo;re here, create a relationship in the
other direction as well. Scroll down to the bottom of the FormBuilder
table and add a new relationship: map the FormName field to the Leads
table&rsquo;s NSFormName field. This time, when you create the relationship,
name it <em>Submissions</em>. Save your changes in the Define Structure tab.</p>
<p>In your Explore Data tab, navigate to the Leads page again to see what
it looks like. Now as you scroll through each lead, you can see which
form was filled out to submit it. Figure
10-12 shows a different example from the
Leads table.</p>
<p>In this case, a member of the public rather than a fusion center member
filled out this form, using a fake name and email address (John Doe and
<em>idont@thinkso.org</em>). They wrote a message, in all caps, about a
fireworks store in Pahrump, Nevada, just over the border from
California:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ON SATURDAYS, ALL 3 STORES ARE PACKED AND OVER 90% OF THE TRAFFIC IS
FROM CA. THEY ARE ALSO ALMOST ALL BLACK OR MEXICAN. NO DISRESPECT TO
RACE, BUT DOESNT THAT SORT OF MEET YOUR PROFILE OF PROBLEMS LATELY? I
DONT REALLY CARE ABOUT THE CAUSES EITHER WAY, BUT THE UNREST IS
HURTING TRUMP. I WOULD BET YOU HAVE A FEW ANTIFA PEOPLE BUYING
FIREWORKS TO CAUSE TROUBLE. JUST THOUGHT I WOULD MENTION IT.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 10-12: An item in the JRIC Leads table, with a cleaned-up relationship to the FormBuilder table" src="media/images/Figure10-12.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 10-12: An item in the JRIC Leads table, with a cleaned-up relationship to the FormBuilder table</em></p>
<p>BlueLeaks Explorer shows you LeadSheetPrivateSectorAndPublic, the form
that was filled out to submit this lead. Scroll to the bottom of the
form and click <strong>Permalink</strong> to go to a page that shows just the
LeadSheetPrivateSectorAndPublic form in the FormBuilder table. Because
of the Submissions relationship you created, this page should show you
everything that was submitted to JRIC using this form&mdash;all 1,949 leads
submitted by the public.</p>
<h3 id="verifying-blueleaks-data">Verifying BlueLeaks Data<a class="headerlink" href="#verifying-blueleaks-data" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Whenever you&rsquo;re looking at leaked or hacked data, you should always do
additional research outside of the dataset itself to help verify that
the data is authentic and put it into context. By looking at the Company
table in the previous section, you learned that the JRIC site is hosted
at https://www.jric.org.
Load that link in Tor Browser (covered in
Chapter 2) or while connected to a VPN, and
check out the JRIC website.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, I could tell from the website that this fusion
center focuses on the Los Angeles area. Some of the BlueLeaks sites went
offline after the hack in 2020, but many, like JRIC, remained online.
Figure 10-13 shows JRIC&rsquo;s website, loaded
anonymously in Tor Browser.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 10-13: The home page of JRIC’s website," src="media/images/Figure10-13.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 10-13: The home page of JRIC’s website,</em></p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t clear to me that JRIC was a fusion center focused on Los
Angeles, or what its mission was, until I viewed its website. If you
click around the JRIC site to get a better understanding of the types of
information it collects, you can then use BlueLeaks Explorer to view
that information. For example, if you click the Submit a SAR link at the
top of the home page, you can find the forms that add SARs to the Leads
table.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve only explored a small amount of content in the JRIC data so far.
Now it&rsquo;s time to finish building the structure so you can explore the
rest.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-10-2-finish-building-the-structure-for-jric">Exercise 10-2: Finish Building the Structure for JRIC<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-10-2-finish-building-the-structure-for-jric" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In the previous sections, you started building the structure for the
JRIC data. You cleaned up the Company, Leads, and FormBuilder tables and
created a relationship between the latter two tables, allowing you to
see which form was submitted to create each lead and which leads were
created from each form. In this exercise, you&rsquo;ll use your newfound
knowledge to finish defining the structure for the other tables in JRIC.
This will give you a clearer understanding of exactly what data was
stored there, making it much easier to continue your investigation. It
will also give you practice creating structures for the rest of the
BlueLeaks sites.</p>
<p>You can play with BlueLeaks Explorer however
you wish to customize the JRIC structure to suit your preferences.
However, if you&rsquo;re not sure where to start, I recommend beginning with
the first table (AgencyNames), then the second (Align), and so on,
finishing with the last table (VideoOptions). If you run into a table
that has a relationship to another table, work on the related table
first before you continue down the list.</p>
<p>For example, here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d start the AgencyNames table. In the Explore
Data tab, in the list of JRIC tables, click <strong>AgencyNames</strong>. This table
has 1,396 rows, and each row has just two fields: AgencyNamesID and
AgencyName. The names appear to be various military agencies, police
departments, school districts, and other organizations&mdash;my guess is
these are all of JRIC&rsquo;s partners. This data is pretty easy to read and
search by itself, so I&rsquo;d consider this table done already.</p>
<p>Still in the Explore Data tab, I&rsquo;d move on to the Align table. This has
just three rows, with the Align field as Left, Right, or Center. This
table is completely useless for the purposes of an investigation. In the
Define Structure tab, find the Align table, click the <strong>Hide</strong> button,
then click <strong>Save</strong>. Back in the Explore Data tab, refresh the page, and
you&rsquo;ll see that the Align table has disappeared.</p>
<p>I find that when building a BlueLeaks Explorer structure, it helps to
read some raw data to begin with, just to try to understand what it is
and how it should be formatted. If you see any fields that are obviously
HTML, for example, change their type from text to <strong>html</strong>. Once you
have an understanding of what the important fields are, you can hide the
rest. And once you&rsquo;re done deciding what fields to show and what their
types should be, you can add any relationships as appropriate.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve structured the JRIC data to more easily explore it, do some
investigating. The JRIC data includes an entire series of training
videos for the Terrorism Liaison Office, split into different modules.
Check out the Video and VideoCategory tables; at the time of writing, no
one has reported on this information.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to define structures in BlueLeaks Explorer, you
can do the same for any other sites in the BlueLeaks dataset to
investigate them in greater depth. BlueLeaks Explorer is most useful
when paired with a tool like Aleph, described in Chapter
5, that indexes the data so you can search it
for keywords. If you index all of the data in BlueLeaks, you can search
it all at once to find documents in various BlueLeaks sites. Then, once
you discover the sites you&rsquo;re interested in, you can do a deep dive on
them using BlueLeaks Explorer.</p>
<h3 id="the-technology-behind-blueleaks-explorer">The Technology Behind BlueLeaks Explorer<a class="headerlink" href="#the-technology-behind-blueleaks-explorer" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes a dataset is so complicated&mdash;and so newsworthy&mdash;that it&rsquo;s
worth writing a custom application just to help you make sense of it.
BlueLeaks Explorer is one such application. The information covered in
this book, especially in Chapters 7 and
8, provides a solid foundation for
the additional independent research required to
build an app like this yourself.</p>
<p>There are many different ways to go about writing custom apps for
investigating datasets. In this section, I describe the technologies and
libraries I used to develop BlueLeaks Explorer: first those I used to
build the <em>backend</em> (the web server), then those I used for the
<em>frontend</em> (the user interface that runs in a web browser). I personally
like this <em>tech stack</em>, or combination of technologies an app uses, but
this is by no means an exhaustive list of possibilities. Most of the
technologies described here are outside the scope of this book; this
section provides just a brief introduction to inspire future research.</p>
<p>If you feel confident in your programming skills and are inclined to do
so, you can make improvements to my BlueLeaks Explorer code in the git
repo and submit them back into the project, since it&rsquo;s open source.</p>
<h4 id="the-backend">The Backend<a class="headerlink" href="#the-backend" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>I developed the backend of BlueLeaks Explorer in Python, relying on a
third-party Python package called Flask, a simple framework for building
web apps. You can learn more about using Flask at
<a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com">https://flask.palletsprojects.com</a>.
You can also check out the source code for BlueLeaks Explorer,
specifically <em>app.py</em> at
<a href="https://github.com/micahflee/blueleaks-explorer/blob/main/src/app.py">https://github.com/micahflee/blueleaks-explorer/blob/main/src/app.py</a>,
to see exactly how I used Flask for this project.</p>
<p>The backend also makes use of built-in Python modules, primarily
<code>json</code> (which you&rsquo;ll learn
about in the next chapter) and <code>sqlite3</code>, which lets you run SQL queries on the
SQLite databases that represent BlueLeaks sites. When a web browser
loads the web server powered by Flask, the web server responds with HTML
that loads some JavaScript code. This is the frontend, described in the
following section.</p>
<p>The backend also implements an API, which allows the frontend to
communicate with it. For example, when the frontend wants to know the
list of sites that already have structures, it can load <em>/api/sites</em> on
the backend, which returns this data in JSON format. If it wants to
retrieve data in JSON format from a specific table on a specific site,
it can load
<em>/api/&lt;site&gt;/&lt;table&gt;</em>.
In this case, the Python code uses the <code>sqlite3</code> module to look up this data in the
SQlite3 database for that BlueLeaks site, and then returns what it finds
to the frontend.</p>
<h4 id="the-frontend">The Frontend<a class="headerlink" href="#the-frontend" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>To develop web applications, you&rsquo;ll have to program not in Python but in
JavaScript, since this is the programming language that web browsers
understand. I developed the frontend of BlueLeaks Explorer using a
JavaScript framework called Vue.js
(<a href="https://vuejs.org">https://vuejs.org</a>).
If you&rsquo;re like me and find that you really enjoy writing code, I
recommend that you try learning JavaScript so that you can make web
applications. You can find the frontend source code at
<a href="https://github.com/micahflee/blueleaks-explorer/tree/main/src/frontend/src">https://github.com/micahflee/blueleaks-explorer/tree/main/src/frontend/src</a>.</p>
<p>Using Vue.js, the BlueLeaks Explorer frontend
includes a series of pages designed to display data it retrieves by
making HTTP requests to the backend. When you save a structure that
you&rsquo;re working on in BlueLeaks Explorer, the frontend also sends data to
the backend, which then saves the structure as a JSON file.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In this chapter, you got BlueLeaks Explorer up and running locally on
your computer using Docker. You&rsquo;ve learned how to define structures for
each BlueLeaks site, make the data in the tables easier to read, and
create relationships between tables. Now that you have the skills
required to investigate anything in the sprawling BlueLeaks dataset, let
me know if you find any revelations!</p>
<p>In the next chapter, you&rsquo;ll learn more about the JSON file format.
You&rsquo;ll work with a dataset containing a million JSON files related to
the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and continue to hone your
Python skills by writing code to find the most important files within
it.</p>
