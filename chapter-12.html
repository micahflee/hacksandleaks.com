          <h1>Chapter 12: Epik Fail, Extremism Research, and SQL Databases</h1>
          <p>On a Saturday morning in late October 2018 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
Robert Bowers posted a message to the fascist-friendly social network
Gab. &ldquo;Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society likes to bring invaders in that
kill our people,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sit by and watch my people get
slaughtered. Screw your optics, I&rsquo;m going in.&rdquo; He was parroting the
&ldquo;great replacement&rdquo; conspiracy theory, popularized in the US by former
Fox News host Tucker Carlson, which claims that Jews are replacing white
people with immigrants of color.</p>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section id="content" data-content="chapter-12">
        <div class="wrapper" id="about-content"><p>Armed with an AR-15 assault rifle and three Glock semi-automatic
pistols, Bowers entered the Tree of Life Synagogue, where three
different Jewish congregations were holding Shabbat services that
morning, and committed the deadliest
antisemitic terrorist attack in US history. He killed 11 people and
wounded 6 others, including several Holocaust survivors.</p>
<p>That day, several companies kicked Gab off their platforms. GoDaddy, the
registrar that Gab used to buy the domain gab.com, sent Gab a letter
saying it had &ldquo;discovered numerous instances of content on your site
that both promotes and encourages violence against people.&rdquo; Gab was down
only for a few days, though, thanks in part to the domain name registrar
and web hosting company Epik, which soon took over registration for
gab.com.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you&rsquo;ll learn about Epik, its extremist customers, and
the 2021 data breach that exposed hundreds of gigabytes of customer
data. You&rsquo;ll download and learn to work with some of the leaked data,
most of which is in the format of structured query language, or SQL
(often pronounced &ldquo;sequel&rdquo;). SQL is a popular database technology that
many websites, online services, and local software use to store data.
This chapter focuses on MySQL databases, which use the SQL software that
Epik uses. You&rsquo;ll also practice using database software called MariaDB,
a community-maintained version of MySQL. Finally, you&rsquo;ll learn to run a
SQL server (software that allows you to host SQL databases), import the
data, and write your own code to search it, skills that will prepare you
for investigating your own SQL datasets in the future.</p>
<h3 id="the-structure-of-sql-databases">The Structure of SQL Databases<a class="headerlink" href="#the-structure-of-sql-databases" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>I have briefly discussed SQL databases in previous chapters, including
Chapter 10, where you converted CSVs into
SQLite databases for BlueLeaks Explorer. There are many types of SQL
databases, including PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle SQL, and
the aforementioned MySQL and SQLite. While they&rsquo;re all based on SQL,
they have minor differences that mean they&rsquo;re not entirely compatible
with each other. SQL databases are popular; therefore, so are SQL data
breaches.</p>
<p>Some SQL database software is proprietary. For example, Microsoft SQL
Server is the version of SQL that Microsoft products require, and it
runs only on Windows. Oracle is another proprietary version of SQL; if
you get a leaked Oracle database, you&rsquo;ll need to use Oracle software to
access it. PostgreSQL and MySQL are free and open source and run on
Linux servers, making them popular and widely used in web development.
SQLite is another free and open source version of SQL. It can&rsquo;t handle
huge databases, but it&rsquo;s very simple and convenient for small
ones&mdash;iPhone and Android apps frequently store their settings in a
SQLite database, for example.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>Some datasets may require you to set up a SQL database server that you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with, or figure out how to convert them into a type of SQL you already know, in order to analyze them. I once contributed to an investigation based on a leaked Chinese police database that revealed the suffocating surveillance of China&rsquo;s Uyghur minority group in the Xinjiang region. It was an Oracle database, but it&rsquo;s unclear whether the Chinese police paid for it or were pirating it. Because Oracle is proprietary and the investigating technologists didn&rsquo;t have an Oracle license or experience with this version of SQL, they decided to convert it into a PostgreSQL database so they could more easily work with the data. Read the full report by Yael Grauer at <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/01/29/china-uyghur-muslim-surveillance-police/">https://theintercept.com/2021/01/29/china-uyghur-muslim-surveillance-police/</a>.</em></p>
<p>Next we&rsquo;ll look at what relational databases are, how SQL servers
typically work, and the terminology used to describe SQL databases and
the data they contain.</p>
<h4 id="relational-databases">Relational Databases<a class="headerlink" href="#relational-databases" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>SQL databases are made up of tables, which you can think of as
spreadsheets comprising a list of rows, with each row containing the
same columns, or <em>fields</em>. SQL databases are useful because they&rsquo;re
<em>relational</em>, meaning that data in different tables can relate to each
other. You saw this firsthand when working with BlueLeaks Explorer: the
BlueLeaks folders had individual spreadsheets like <em>Documents.csv</em> and
<em>DocumentCategory.csv</em>, but once you converted them into SQLite
databases, you could rely on the relationship between the Documents and
the DocumentCategory tables to browse BlueLeaks documents by category.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a simple example: a database that contains two related
tables for books and authors. Table 12-1
shows the information stored in the <code>authors</code> table.</p>
<p><em>Table 12-1: The <code>authors</code> Table</em></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><code>id</code></th>
<th><code>name</code></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Micah Lee</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Carl Sagan</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Table 12-2 shows the information stored in the <code>books</code> table.</p>
<p><em>Table 12-2: The <code>books</code> Table</em></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><code>id</code></th>
<th><code>title</code></th>
<th><code>author_id</code></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Pale Blue Dot</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Contact: A Novel</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each SQL database can contain multiple tables, and each table has a
defined set of fields. For example, Table 12-2 has <code>id</code>, <code>title</code>, and <code>author_id</code> fields.</p>
<p>Every table in a SQL database normally has a unique <code>id</code> field that <em>auto-increments</em>, meaning
that when you add rows of data to the table, the first row is
automatically given an <code>id</code> of
1, the second is given an <code>id</code>
of 2, and so on, ensuring that no two rows ever have the same
<code>id</code>. If Table 12-1 included two authors named Micah Lee, it
would be clear in the database that they&rsquo;re not the same person, because
the ID for each row would be different.</p>
<p>In general, tables relate to each other using
these unique ID numbers. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re browsing through the
<code>books</code> table and come across
<em>Contact: A Novel</em>. Who wrote it? According to the data in its row, the
<code>author_id</code> is <code>2</code>. To find out who the author is, you&rsquo;d
look at the <code>authors</code> table
for the row with the <code>id</code> of
<code>2</code> to find that it&rsquo;s Carl
Sagan.</p>
<p>This example deals with a small amount of data, but SQL databases can
become huge and complicated. For example, instead of two authors, you
might find a database with 10 million users and all sorts of tables that
relate to it using a field called <code>user_id</code>.</p>
<h4 id="clients-and-servers">Clients and Servers<a class="headerlink" href="#clients-and-servers" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Most types of SQL databases are <em>server</em> software, meaning you install a
SQL server to hold all of the data. Other computers then use a SQL
<em>client</em> to communicate with that server to search for, add, or update
data. This communication is similar to how websites work: a web server
has the software that runs the website, while a web browser (the client)
connects to the server remotely to load web pages, submit forms, and so
on. SQL clients communicate to servers using SQL queries, also known as
<em>statements</em>. Similarly to English, SQL queries start with a <em>verb</em> that
describes an action being taken and have <em>clauses</em> that further describe
that action. All SQL queries end with semicolons (<code>;</code>).</p>
<p>Each SQL server can host multiple databases. For example, you could run
20 different WordPress websites on the same MySQL server by having each
website use a different database. The Epik dataset includes data from
nine different MySQL databases. If you downloaded them all, you could
import all nine into the same MySQL server. Because much of the Epik
data is in MySQL format, in Exercise 12-1 you&rsquo;ll run a MySQL server in
Docker. Once you have a server running, you&rsquo;ll connect to it later using
a client to import the data and begin your analysis.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you&rsquo;ll try out two different MySQL clients: the
web-based client Adminer and the <code>mysql</code> command line client, which allows you
to interact with the database from the terminal. For MySQL, Adminer is
more user-friendly for manually browsing a SQL database, but
<code>mysql</code> is especially useful
for working on remote servers and creating or restoring database
backups. For a simpler introduction to working with clients, you&rsquo;ll use
Adminer in the first half of this chapter, then move on to the command
line client. All clients interact with servers in the same way, sending
SQL queries to the SQL server, which runs them and returns a response.
Therefore, the skills you learn using Adminer will also apply to the CLI
client.</p>
<p>SQL servers also normally have a system of users and permissions that
allow you to grant a given user access to some databases but not others.
The root user on MySQL and other databases has total access to every
database on the server. When you&rsquo;re researching a leaked database, it&rsquo;s
fine to run all of your searches as the root user since you&rsquo;re typically
the only person using that server. However, if you&rsquo;re running a database
that strangers online might use, such as a website powered by a SQL
database, you should use non-root database users with restricted
permissions. This way, if one of those strangers hacks your database,
they&rsquo;ll have access only to what that specific database user has
permissions for.</p>
<h4 id="tables-columns-and-types">Tables, Columns, and Types<a class="headerlink" href="#tables-columns-and-types" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You can store only a single type of data in each column in a SQL table.
For example, you can store strings, but not numerals, in the
<code>title</code> column of Table 12-2 (though you could get around this by
storing a string representation of a number, like the string
<code>'1'</code> instead of the number
<code>1</code>).</p>
<p>Data types differ slightly depending on the flavor of SQL you&rsquo;re using.
However, you&rsquo;ll generally see types representing numbers, times, or
strings of text. The following list includes some common SQL types that
are all valid in MySQL:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>INT</code> Integers or whole numbers</p>
<p><code>DECIMAL</code> Numbers with decimal places</p>
<p><code>DATE</code> A specific date</p>
<p><code>DATETIME</code> A specific date, along with the time of day</p>
<p><code>VARCHAR</code> A string of characters of a specified length</p>
<p><code>TEXT</code> Also a string of text</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Table 12-2 were stored in a MySQL
database, <code>id</code> would be type
<code>INT</code>, <code>title</code> would be type <code>TEXT</code>, and <code>author_id</code> would be type <code>INT</code>. If you tried storing the string
<code>"hola"</code> in the
<code>author_id</code> field, the SQL
server would respond with an error message, because the data isn&rsquo;t an
integer.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="the-history-of-mariadb">THE HISTORY OF MARIADB<a class="headerlink" href="#the-history-of-mariadb" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>MySQL was first released in 1995 as open source SQL database software maintained by the Swedish company MySQL AB. For nearly two decades it reigned as the most popular database for web apps, ushering in the early internet’s Web 2.0 era. Wildly popular web app software like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and MediaWiki (which powers Wikipedia) were all built on MySQL databases and developed in the PHP programming language.`</p>
<p>In 2008, Sun Microsystems acquired MySQL AB, and with it the MySQL software. In 2009, Oracle announced that it was acquiring Sun Microsystems. The MySQL community had many concerns about the future of the project in Oracle’s hands, including that it would cease to be open source. In response, the database’s original creator, Michael “Monty” Widenius, forked MySQL into a new version, MariaDB, that would remain open forever. (<em>Forking</em> an open source project means starting a whole new open source project that’s based on the code of an existing project.) Many of the original MySQL developers stopped working on MySQL and moved to the MariaDB project.</p>
<p>MariaDB is completely compatible with MySQL, and you can seamlessly switch between the two database servers and clients. The command line client that comes with MySQL will connect to a MariaDB server, and the command line client that comes with MariaDB will connect to a MySQL server. I’ve found that it’s easier to get MariaDB up and running than the original MySQL software, so you’ll use a MariaDB server for the exercises in this chapter. However, since MariaDB is completely compatible with MySQL, it’s common to use the terms interchangeably. I’ll refer to both as MySQL for the remainder of the chapter, except when referring to specific MariaDB software packages.</p>
<p>When Widenius originally created MySQL, he named it after his daughter, My. When he forked MySQL into MariaDB in 2009, he named the new project after his youngest daughter, Maria.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The simplest way to run a MariaDB server on your computer is by using
Docker containers, like you did in Exercise 5-3 when you set up a local
WordPress website as practice using Docker Compose. In the following
exercises, you&rsquo;ll get a MySQL server up and running, connect to your new
server using MySQL clients, and practice using SQL.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-12-1-create-and-test-a-mysql-server-using-docker-and-adminer">Exercise 12-1: Create and Test a MySQL Server Using Docker and Adminer<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-12-1-create-and-test-a-mysql-server-using-docker-and-adminer" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>With Docker, you can quickly run different types of SQL servers on your
computer, no matter what operating system you&rsquo;re running. In this
exercise, you&rsquo;ll run a MariaDB server on your computer using Docker
Compose. Once you have the server up and running, you&rsquo;ll use the Adminer
MySQL client to add the contents of Tables 12-1 and 12-2 to
it as a test. You&rsquo;ll move on to working with real leaked data later in
the chapter, but you&rsquo;ll start by experimenting with some simple example
databases.</p>
<h4 id="run-the-server">Run the Server<a class="headerlink" href="#run-the-server" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Create a folder for this chapter&rsquo;s exercises and a <em>docker-compose.yaml</em>
file in that folder. Type the following code into the file (or copy and
paste it from

</code></pre></div>

<p>The <em>docker-compose.yaml</em> file in Exercise 5-3 used a <code>db</code> service running MariaDB, and a
<code>wordpress</code> service running
the WordPress container. In that case, <code>wordpress</code> connected to <code>db</code> to run queries in order to save and
load website content. This code uses an <code>adminer</code> service to likewise connect to the
<code>db</code> service.</p>
<p>The code provides the version number of the Compose specification with
which the file is written (<code>3.9</code>). It then defines the two services and
includes the version of the <code>mariadb</code> container image that the <code>db</code> service runs. It sets the database
root user&rsquo;s password to <code>this-is-your-root-password</code> (change this to a different password
if you like). As noted earlier, you&rsquo;ll work as the database&rsquo;s root user
throughout this chapter, since you&rsquo;re the only one accessing this
database. It publishes port 3306, meaning that you can connect to the
server with a MySQL client on <em>localhost</em> at port 3306, and configures a
volume to store all of MariaDB&rsquo;s database files in a <em>db_data</em> folder.
You&rsquo;ll import several gigabytes of data into this database.</p>
<p>The <code>adminer</code> service runs the
latest version of the <code>adminer</code> container image. Adminer publishes
port 8080, so you can load Adminer in a web browser at
<em>http://localhost:8080</em>.</p>
<p>Open a terminal, change to the folder for this chapter&rsquo;s exercises, and
start the containers with the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>docker-compose<span class="w"> </span>up
</code></pre></div>

<p>The first time you start the containers, your computer downloads the
container images from Docker Hub, if you don&rsquo;t already have them. After
the containers start, you should see that a <em>db_data</em> folder containing
all of the data stored in the database so far has been added to your
<em>exercises</em> folder.</p>
<h4 id="connect-to-the-database-with-adminer">Connect to the Database with Adminer<a class="headerlink" href="#connect-to-the-database-with-adminer" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You just started two containers, one for your MySQL server and the other
for your MySQL client, Adminer. Now you&rsquo;ll connect to Adminer and use it
to log in to your MySQL server. To access Adminer, open a browser and
load <em>http://localhost:8080</em>. You should
see the Adminer login page shown in Figure
12-1. Here you can choose the type of
database to which you&rsquo;re connecting and what credentials you&rsquo;ll use to
log in. Keep System as MySQL, keep Server as db, set Username to
<strong>root</strong>, and set Password to <strong>this-is-your-root-password</strong> (or
whatever you used in your <em>docker-compose.yaml</em> file). Leave the
Database field blank, since you haven&rsquo;t imported any databases yet.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve logged in, you should see a list of default databases:
<code>information_schema</code>,
<code>mysql</code>,
<code>performance_schema</code>, and
<code>sys</code>. MariaDB uses these to
store information it needs to run the database server, so in general,
you shouldn&rsquo;t touch them. Instead, you&rsquo;ll create new databases and work
with them.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 12-1: The Adminer login page" src="media/images/Figure12-1.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 12-1: The Adminer login page</em></p>
<h4 id="create-a-test-database">Create a Test Database<a class="headerlink" href="#create-a-test-database" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>To test out your new MySQL server, you&rsquo;ll create a brand-new database
and enter Tables 12-1 and
12-2. Click the <strong>Create Database</strong> link,
enter <strong>books</strong> in the field that pops up, and click <strong>Save</strong>. Once
you&rsquo;ve created the books database, click the <strong>Create Table</strong> link.
Under Table Name, enter <strong>authors</strong>.</p>
<p>To add a column in Adminer, you enter its name under the Column Name
header and choose a data type. To enter the first column from Table
12-1, create an <strong>id</strong> column and choose type
<strong>int</strong> (short for &ldquo;integer,&rdquo; as mentioned earlier). Select the <strong>AI</strong>
radio button, which sets this column to auto-increment. When you&rsquo;ve
finished, create the second column, <strong>name</strong>, with type <strong>text</strong>.</p>
<p>Figure 12-2 shows what the form should look
like when you&rsquo;ve finished.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 12-2: Creating the authors" src="media/images/Figure12-2.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 12-2: Creating the authors</em></p>
<p>Click <strong>Save</strong> to finish creating the table in the database. Adminer
should bring you to the structure page for your new table, showing you
the two columns you just created. Your table should start out empty,
without any rows.</p>
<p>At the top of the window, you should see page navigation links (for
example, MySQL ▸ db ▸ books in Figure
12-2). Click <strong>books</strong> to return to the books
database page, then click <strong>Create Table</strong> again to create Table
12-2, giving it the name <strong>books</strong>. Add the
following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <strong>id</strong> column with type <strong>int</strong> and
    <strong>AI</strong> checked</li>
<li>A <strong>title</strong> column with type <strong>text</strong></li>
<li>An <strong>author_id</strong> column</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>Adminer is smart enough to determine on its own that the author_id
column uses the <code>int</code>
type and relates to the authors.id column, so it will automatically set
the type to <code>authors</code>.</em></p>
<p>Figure 12-3 shows what this form should look
like once you&rsquo;ve added these columns.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 12-3: Creating the books table in Adminer" src="media/images/Figure12-3.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 12-3: Creating the books table in Adminer</em></p>
<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>. You&rsquo;ve now created a <code>books</code> database with two tables,
<code>authors</code> and <code>books</code>, but there isn&rsquo;t any data in it yet.</p>
<p>Now that you have a MySQL database running on your computer and access
to the Adminer MySQL client, you&rsquo;re ready to run your own SQL queries.
Your first queries will add the data from Tables 12-1 and 12-2
into their corresponding MySQL tables.</p>

<p>In this exercise, you&rsquo;ll learn the syntax of SQL queries. You&rsquo;ll be
using MySQL, but the syntax is nearly identical to that of all other
types of SQL, so this section should give you a solid foundation for
writing SQL queries in general. You&rsquo;ll learn the different verbs and
practice running SQL queries to add, update, delete, and most
importantly, search the data in SQL databases.</p>
<p>Make sure that your Docker containers from Exercise 12-1 are up, then
load Adminer in your web browser at
<em>http://localhost:8080</em>. Also make sure
you&rsquo;ve logged in to your MySQL server as the root user, using the same
password from the previous exercise. When you&rsquo;re ready, click the
<strong>books</strong> database to begin.</p>

<p>So far the <code>books</code> database
you created in Exercise 12-1 includes the tables <code>authors</code> and <code>books</code>, but those tables don&rsquo;t have any rows.</p>
<p>To add new rows to your tables, you use the <code>INSERT</code> verb as follows:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">INSERT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">INTO</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">table_name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">column1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">column2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">...)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">VALUES</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">value1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">value2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">...);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In Adminer, click the <strong>SQL Command</strong> link in the left sidebar. In the
empty field that pops up, enter the following <code>INSERT</code> queries:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">INSERT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">INTO</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">authors</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">VALUES</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Micah Lee&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>

<p>These commands insert all of the rows into the two tables in the
database, one row at a time. The first two lines insert rows into the
<code>authors</code> table, just setting
the <code>name</code> field, while the
last three lines insert rows into the <code>books</code> table, setting the <code>title</code> and <code>author_id</code> fields. These <code>INSERT</code> statements don&rsquo;t specify <code>id</code> values because the <code>id</code> field for both tables auto-increments,
starting with <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>While you don&rsquo;t need to set the <code>id</code> field when inserting into the
<code>books</code> table, you do need to
set the <code>author_id</code> field
manually, which is how you tell the database who the author of each book
is. Since the <code>authors</code> table
started out empty, the author row for <code>Micah Lee</code> should have an <code>id</code> of <code>1</code> (as it was the first row added to the
table), and the row for <code>Carl Sagan</code> should have an <code>id</code> of <code>2</code>. When the code inserts the
<code>Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations</code> title, it sets
<code>author"SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11"&gt;1</code>, and when it inserts the two books by
Carl Sagan, it sets <code>author_id</code> to <code>2</code>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>In this chapter I write SQL keywords like <code>INSERT</code> and <code>WHERE</code> in all caps, but doing so is
just a popular convention. SQL keywords aren&rsquo;t case sensitive, so you
can use <code>insert</code>,
<code>where</code>,
<code>select</code>, and so on
if you prefer.</em></p>
<p>Figure 12-4 shows the process of inserting
data into the <code>authors</code> and
<code>books</code> tables by running
these five <code>INSERT</code> queries.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 12-4: Running INSERT queries in Adminer" src="media/images/Figure12-4.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 12-4: Running INSERT queries in Adminer</em></p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve entered this series of SQL queries
into Adminer, click <strong>Execute</strong> to run them, which should insert all of
these rows into your database. Click <strong>select</strong> in the left sidebar to
view the new data in the database. Figure
12-5 shows all of the rows in the
<code>books</code> tables in Adminer.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 12-5: Viewing rows in the books table in Adminer" src="media/images/Figure12-5.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 12-5: Viewing rows in the books table in Adminer</em></p>
<p>Right above the table of data in Figure
12-5, you can see the line
<code>SELECT * from 'books' LIMIT 50</code> <code>(0.0002 s)</code>, which is the SQL statement Adminer
executed to retrieve this data from the MySQL database, followed by the
amount of time it took for the query to run.</p>
<h4 id="select-statements">SELECT Statements<a class="headerlink" href="#select-statements" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>While <code>INSERT</code> statements add
information to SQL databases, <code>SELECT</code> statements ask a database for specific
information. When investigating leaked SQL databases, you&rsquo;ll likely
spend most of your time writing <code>SELECT</code> statements.</p>
<p>You can use a <code>SELECT</code>
statement to select all of the books by a certain author or, in the case
of Epik data, all of the domain names registered by a specific person.
Here&rsquo;s the general syntax:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">column1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">column2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">...</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">table_name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">WHERE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">condition</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">ORDER</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">BY</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">column1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">column2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">...;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>When your SQL client runs a <code>SELECT</code> statement, the SQL server returns a
table of data. To select everything in the <code>books</code> table, click the <strong>SQL Command</strong> link
in Adminer&rsquo;s left sidebar and run the following query:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">books</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This command uses an asterisk (<code>*</code>) as a wildcard character, which means
you&rsquo;d like the response to include all columns. It also leaves out the
<code>WHERE</code> clause, so it will include all of the
rows in the <code>books</code> table
without filtering them. Figure 12-6 shows
these results in Adminer.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 12-6: Running a SELECT query in Adminer" src="media/images/Figure12-6.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 12-6: Running a SELECT query in Adminer</em></p>
<p>After running a <code>SELECT</code>
query, click Adminer&rsquo;s <strong>Export</strong> link to export the data returned as a
CSV spreadsheet. The options in the first drop-down menu are <em>open</em>,
which allows you to open a CSV directly in your browser; <em>save</em>, used to
download the CSV; and <em>gzip</em>, which lets you download a compressed
version of the CSV. The three options in the second drop-down menu allow
you to save the file with data separated by commas, semicolons, or tab
characters.</p>
<p>You can open spreadsheets created this way in software like Microsoft
Excel or LibreOffice Calc and work with the data using that software.
This makes it easier to share the data with colleagues or use advanced
features like visualizing the data.</p>
<h5 id="selecting-individual-fields">Selecting Individual Fields<a class="headerlink" href="#selecting-individual-fields" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>You previously ran the <code>SELECT * FROM table_name</code> query to select all the
columns in a table, but you can also choose only specific columns. Say
you want to return only a list of titles in the table. Select the
<code>title</code> field alone with this
query:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">title</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">books</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Instead of including all columns, this table includes only the book
titles. The SQL server should return the results shown in Table 12-3. (For the remainder of this section, for simplicity&rsquo;s sake, I&rsquo;ll represent the information returned from SQL
queries as tables in text rather than Adminer screenshots.)</p>
<p><em>Table 12-3: The <code>title</code> Column in the <code>books</code> Table</em></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><code>title</code></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pale Blue Dot</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Contact: A Novel</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>When you&rsquo;re working with larger databases, select only the columns you
need so your queries will finish faster.</p>
<h5 id="sorting-results">Sorting Results<a class="headerlink" href="#sorting-results" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Use the <code>ORDER BY</code> clause to
sort the results of your queries. For example, to select all of the
columns in the <code>books</code> table,
with the results sorted by the book title, run this query:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">books</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">ORDER</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">BY</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">title</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The results of this query will be ordered alphabetically by the title
column, as shown in Table 12-4.</p>
<p><em>Table 12-4: All Columns in the <code>books</code> Table, Ordered by the <code>title</code> Column</em></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><code>id</code></th>
<th><code>title</code></th>
<th><code>author_id</code></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Contact: A Novel</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Pale Blue Dot</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>By default, results are sorted in ascending order: text fields are
ordered alphabetically; number fields are ordered from smallest to
largest; and date fields are ordered from earliest to latest. You can
sort the results in descending order by using the <code>DESC</code> keyword. For example, use the
following query to select all of the books, ordered by <code>title</code> column in reverse alphabetical order:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">books</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">ORDER</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">BY</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">title</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">DESC</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can also sort results by more than one column. For example, to first
order the books by <code>author_id</code>
(so the results will include all books by author 1 first, then by author
2, and so on), and then by <code>title</code> (so that within each author&rsquo;s list of
books, the books are sorted by title), run this query:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">books</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">ORDER</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">BY</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">author_id</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">title</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This should order the results first by <code>author_id</code>, then by <code>title</code>, as shown in Table
12-5.</p>
<p><em>Table 12-5: All Columns in the <code>books</code> Table, Ordered by <code>author_id</code> and <code>title</code></em></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><code>id</code></th>
<th><code>title</code></th>
<th><code>author_id</code></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Contact: A Novel</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Pale Blue Dot</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In this case, all of the books by the author with <code>author_id</code> of <code>1</code> (Micah Lee) are shown first, and the
books by the author with <code>author_id</code> of <code>2</code> (Carl Sagan) are shown next. The books
for each author are then sorted alphabetically by <code>title</code>.</p>
<h5 id="counting-rows-in-a-table">Counting Rows in a Table<a class="headerlink" href="#counting-rows-in-a-table" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>SQL databases have built-in functions you can run as part of your
queries. For example, to find out how many rows are in the
<code>books</code> table, use the
<code>COUNT()</code> function:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">COUNT</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">books</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>After you run this command, the SQL server should return the results
shown in Table 12-6.</p>
<p><em>Table 12-6: Counting the Number of Rows in the <code>books</code> Table</em></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><code>COUNT(*)</code></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Selecting <code>COUNT(*)</code> from a
table is considerably faster than selecting all of the rows in that
table and then counting them.</p>
<h5 id="filtering-select-results-with-where-clauses">Filtering SELECT Results with WHERE Clauses<a class="headerlink" href="#filtering-select-results-with-where-clauses" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>You can also filter the results you get back using the <code>WHERE</code> clause. For instance, to find the
titles of books written by Micah Lee, run the following query:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">title</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">books</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">WHERE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">author_id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The SQL server should return the results shown in Table 12-7.</p>
<p><em>Table 12-7: The <code>title</code> of <code>books</code> Where <code>author</code> is Micah Lee</em></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><code>title</code></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Similarly to Python <code>if</code>
statements, the <code>WHERE</code> clause
also supports parentheses and Boolean logic operators <code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code>, as well as the comparison
operators greater than (<code>&gt;</code>), greater than or equal to
(<code>&gt;=</code>), less than (<code>&lt;</code>), and less than or equal to
(<code>&lt;=</code>). For example, say you
want to search for books with an <code>id</code> between 10 and 100, including the
number 10 but not the number 100. Try that out with the following query:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">books</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">WHERE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">id</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&gt;=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">AND</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">id</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can use the equals (<code>=</code>)
operator to search for exact strings. For example, run the following
command to find all of the authors with the name Carl Sagan:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">authors</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">WHERE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;Carl Sagan&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This search is case sensitive, so while it would find authors named Carl
Sagan, it wouldn&rsquo;t find authors named CARL SAGAN or carl sagan. For a
case-insensitive search, use the <code>LIKE</code> operator. Try running the following
command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">authors</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">WHERE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">LIKE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;carl sagan&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This command finds authors named Carl Sagan, CARL SAGAN, carl sagan, or
any other capitalization.</p>
<p>The <code>LIKE</code> operator supports
the wildcard character, the percent sign (<code>%</code>), which will match any characters.
Querying the <code>authors</code> table
where <code>name LIKE '%lee%'</code> will
search for rows where <code>name</code>
contains any number of characters (<code>%</code>), followed by <code>lee</code>, followed by any number of characters
again (<code>%</code>). For example, to
find all of the authors with Lee in their names, run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">authors</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">WHERE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">LIKE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;%lee%&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This query returns the row with the name <code>Micah Lee</code>, but it would also return Stan Lee,
Lee Young-ae, and Andrea Leeds.</p>
<p>To search just for people with the last name Lee, run this query:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">authors</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">WHERE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">LIKE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;% lee&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In this case, there&rsquo;s only one wildcard character at the beginning of
the string, followed by a space, followed by <code>lee</code>. This query will return Stan Lee,
since this name matches any number of characters, followed by a space,
followed by <code>lee</code>. However, it
won&rsquo;t return Lee Young-ae; this name matches any number of characters
but has no space followed by <code>lee</code>, and it contains extra characters
after <code>lee</code>.</p>
<p>Using logical operators, you can combine as many conditions as you want.
For example, to look for books written by Carl Sagan that have the word
<em>blue</em> in their titles, run this query:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">books</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">WHERE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">author_id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">AND</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">title</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">LIKE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;%blue%&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You could expand on that query by running the
following query to also check for books with <em>green</em> or <em>red</em> in their
titles:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span>
<span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">books</span>
<span class="k">WHERE</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">author_id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">AND</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">(</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="n">title</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">LIKE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;%red%&#39;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">OR</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="n">title</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">LIKE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;%green%&#39;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">OR</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="n">title</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">LIKE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;%blue%&#39;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This query uses both the logical operators <code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code>, as well as parentheses. When you run
it, the SQL server will reject any rows where <code>author_id</code> isn&rsquo;t <code>2</code> and where <code>title</code> doesn&rsquo;t contain at least one of the
strings <code>red</code>, <code>green</code>, or <code>blue</code>.</p>
<p>This final query has multiple lines, with some of them indented. As your
queries get longer, using whitespace like this can make your SQL queries
easier to read. In general, I tend to write short queries on a single
line and split longer queries into multiple lines. You&rsquo;ll continue
indenting your queries in the following sections.</p>
<p>You should now have a basic understanding of how to select data from a
table in a SQL database. In the next section, you&rsquo;ll learn to select
data from multiple tables at once.</p>
<h4 id="join-clauses">JOIN Clauses<a class="headerlink" href="#join-clauses" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Because SQL databases are relational, you can select data from and
receive results from columns from multiple tables simultaneously using
<code>JOIN</code> clauses. You can think
of these clauses as the SQL server combining (joining) multiple tables
into a single table, then selecting rows from that combined table.</p>
<p>For example, say you want to write a single query that will return a
table of book titles and their authors, relying on the <code>title</code> field in the <code>books</code> table and the <code>name</code> field in the <code>authors</code> table. Run the query in Listing 12-1 to select a table of results from
columns in those two tables at once.</p>

<p><em>Listing 12-1: Selecting from both the <code>books</code> and the <code>authors</code> tables using the <code>JOIN</code> clause</em></p>
<p>Since this query involves more than one table, you must specify the
names of the columns you want to select in the format
<code>table_name.column_name</code>. The SQL query selects the
book title with <code>books.title</code>
and the author name with <code>authors.name</code>. The <code>FROM</code> clause shows that this query is
selecting <em>from</em> the <code>books</code> table and joining this table with the
<code>authors</code> table. The
<code>JOIN</code> clause explains how the
two tables are related: the SQL server knows that a <code>books</code> row is related to an <code>authors</code> row if the value of
<code>books.author_id</code> matches the
value of <code>authors.id</code>.</p>
<p>When you run this query, the SQL database uses the
<code>books.author_id=authors.id</code> relationship specified in the
<code>JOIN</code> clause to build the
combined table shown in Table 12-8, from
which it can then select rows.</p>
<p><em>Table 12-8: The <code>books</code> and <code>authors</code> Tables, Combined on <code>books.author_id = authors.id</code></em></p>

<p>Each row in this combined table includes all of the columns from both
the <code>books</code> and the
<code>authors</code> tables. First,
notice that the value in each row for <code>books.author_id</code> is the same as the
<code>authors.id</code> value. This is
because of the <code>books.author_id=authors.id</code> relationship specified in the
<code>JOIN</code> clause. In each row,
the books fields contain full rows from the <code>books</code> table, and the authors fields contain
full rows from the <code>authors</code>
table. Since Carl Sagan has two books in this database, his books take
up two rows in the combined table.</p>
<p>The <code>SELECT</code> query in Listing 12-1 selects the columns
<code>books.title</code> and
<code>authors.name</code> from this
combined table. This final result of the query should contain the
information in Table 12-9.</p>

<p>The SQL server responds with a single table of rows that contains fields
from both tables, based on the <code>books.author_id=authors.id</code> relationship specified in the
<code>JOIN</code> clause.</p>
<p>The type of join described in this section is technically called an
<code>INNER JOIN</code>, which is the
default type of join in MySQL. In addition to <code>INNER</code> joins, however, you can also use
<code>LEFT</code> and <code>RIGHT</code> joins.</p>
<h5 id="using-left-and-right-joins">Using LEFT and RIGHT Joins<a class="headerlink" href="#using-left-and-right-joins" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>There are two additional ways to join tables together in SQL:
<code>LEFT JOIN</code> and
<code>RIGHT JOIN</code> queries. Each
time you join two tables, the table from which you&rsquo;re selecting is the
&ldquo;left&rdquo; table (<code>books</code>, in the
previous example). The table with which you&rsquo;re joining is the &ldquo;right&rdquo;
table (<code>authors</code>, in this
case). <code>LEFT JOIN</code> means that
the combined table should contain all of the rows from the left
table, but not necessarily all of the rows from
the right table. As you might guess, <code>RIGHT JOIN</code> means that the combined table should
contain all the rows in the right table, but not necessarily those from
the left. Finally, as you saw in the previous section,
<code>INNER JOIN</code> means that the
results should contain only rows where the relationship holds. That is,
if there are any rows in the left table that don&rsquo;t match any rows in the
right table&mdash;and vice versa&mdash;based on the join relationship, then
those rows won&rsquo;t be included in the results.</p>
<p>To demonstrate how this works, use the following query to add a row to
the <code>authors</code> table, replacing
<code>Your Name</code> with your
own name:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">INSERT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">INTO</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">authors</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">VALUES</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Your Name&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now run the query in Listing 12-2.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">books</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">title</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">authors</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">name</span>
<span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">authors</span>
<span class="k">LEFT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">JOIN</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">books</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">ON</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">books</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">author_id</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">authors</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><em>Listing 12-2: Selecting from the <code>authors</code> table and doing a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> to the <code>books</code> table</em></p>
<p>This query is similar to the one in Listing 12-1, but this time it selects from the
<code>authors</code> table (making it the
left table) and joins it with the <code>books</code> table (making that the right table),
using a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> instead of
an <code>INNER JOIN</code>. The results
of that query contain the information in Table 12-10.</p>
<p><em>Table 12-10: Results from a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> Query, with the Left Table Containing More Rows</em></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><code>title</code></th>
<th><code>name</code></th>

<td>Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations</td>
<td>Micah Lee</td>

<tr>
<td>NULL</td>
<td><em>Your Name</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Table 12-10 has an extra row that the
output of Listing 12-1 didn&rsquo;t have. In this
row, the book <code>title</code> column
is <code>NULL</code>, a SQL term meaning
&ldquo;empty,&rdquo; and the author <code>name</code>
column is your own name. Because this is a <code>LEFT JOIN</code>, the results include all rows from the
left table (<code>authors</code>), even
though there aren&rsquo;t any rows from the right table (<code>books</code>) associated with it in the
relationship.</p>
<p>If you ran the same query as Listing 12-2
but instead used an <code>INNER JOIN</code> (or just a <code>JOIN</code>, since inner joins are the default
join type), the results wouldn&rsquo;t include that last row. Your
<code>LEFT JOIN</code> results included
all rows from the left table (<code>authors</code>), including the extra author you added
(your own name). But when you do an <code>INNER JOIN</code>, the results include only rows from
the left and right tables where a relationship holds. Since there aren&rsquo;t
any books with the <code>books.author_id</code> set to your own <code>author.id</code>, the relationship doesn&rsquo;t hold, so the
results don&rsquo;t include that row.</p>
<p>Which type of <code>JOIN</code> you need
to use depends on the type of analysis you&rsquo;re trying to do.
<code>INNER JOIN</code> is a reasonable
default, but if the SQL results you&rsquo;re getting are missing data that you
want, then you&rsquo;ll probably want to use a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> instead.</p>
<h5 id="using-where-clauses-with-joins">Using WHERE Clauses with Joins<a class="headerlink" href="#using-where-clauses-with-joins" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>As with other <code>SELECT</code>
statements, you can use the <code>WHERE</code> clause along with <code>JOIN</code> clauses to filter your results. To
find all titles written by Carl Sagan without knowing what his
<code>id</code> is in the
<code>authors</code> table, run this
query:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">books</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">title</span>
<span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">books</span>
<span class="k">LEFT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">JOIN</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">authors</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">ON</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">books</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">author_id</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">authors</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">id</span>
<span class="k">WHERE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">authors</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;Carl Sagan&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This query selects the column <code>books.title</code> from the <code>books</code> table and joins it with the
<code>authors</code> table using the
<code>books.author_id=authors.id</code> relationship. It then filters those
results to only show the rows where <code>authors.name</code> is Carl Sagan. This query should
return the results shown in Table 12-11.</p>
<p><em>Table 12-11: Selecting from the <code>books</code> Table Based on a Column in the Related <code>authors</code> Table</em></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><code>title</code></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Pale Blue Dot</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Contact: A Novel</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As with the other <code>SELECT</code>
statement, you can also sort your results. If you wanted to sort these
by title, you&rsquo;d add <code>ORDER BY books.title</code> to the query.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve now learned the trickiest parts of searching SQL databases for
information. Next, we&rsquo;ll discuss two more simple SQL verbs:
<code>UPDATE</code> and <code>DELETE</code>.</p>
<h4 id="update-statements">UPDATE Statements<a class="headerlink" href="#update-statements" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You can update rows in a table using the <code>UPDATE</code> verb, which uses this syntax:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">UPDATE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">table_name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">SET</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">column1</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">value1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">column2</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">value2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">...</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">WHERE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">condition</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>For example, try updating this book&rsquo;s title to include its subtitle by
running the follow query:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">UPDATE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">books</span>
<span class="k">SET</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">title</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations: The Art of Analyzing Hacked and Leaked Data&#39;</span>
<span class="k">WHERE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This should have updated the <code>title</code> of the book with the <code>id</code> of <code>1</code> from
<code>Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations</code> to
<code>Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations: The Art of Analyzing Hacked and Leaked Data</code>.</p>
<h4 id="delete-statements">DELETE Statements<a class="headerlink" href="#delete-statements" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>To delete rows in a table, use the <code>DELETE</code> verb, which takes the following
syntax:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">DELETE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">table_name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">WHERE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">condition</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>For example, you could delete the
<code>Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations</code> book from the database by running this
query (but don&rsquo;t do this now, as you&rsquo;ll want to keep this row for
exercises later in the chapter):</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">DELETE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">books</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">WHERE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In this case, the condition is <code>id``=1</code>, so this query finds any rows with an
<code>id</code> of 1 and deletes them.
Alternatively, if you wanted to delete all of the books with me as the
author, the condition could be <code>author_id=1</code>. Or if you wanted to delete all of the
books with <em>blue</em> in their titles, the condition could be
<code>title LIKE '%blue%'</code>.</p>
<h3 id="introducing-the-mysql-command-line-client">Introducing the MySQL Command Line Client<a class="headerlink" href="#introducing-the-mysql-command-line-client" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>So far, you&rsquo;ve run all of your SQL queries through Adminer for a simpler
user experience as you learned the basics of SQL. MySQL clients like
Adminer work well for everyday tasks like browsing data in databases,
running individual queries, and quickly creating new tables. However,
for some tasks, you&rsquo;ll need to use the <code>mysql</code> command line client.</p>
<p>For example, later in this chapter, you&rsquo;ll use the <code>mysql</code> client to import data from a SQL
backup file from the Epik dataset into your MySQL server. SQL backup
files are simply text files, generally with filenames that end in
<em>.sql</em>, full of SQL queries&mdash;sometimes several gigabytes of SQL
queries. To import the backup, the client runs each query in the file,
one after the other. Adminer&rsquo;s import feature allows you to upload a
<em>.sql</em> file, but the Adminer Docker service has an upload limit of 128MB
by default. The SQL backup from the Epik dataset you&rsquo;ll work with later
in this chapter is 1.2GB compressed, so it would be impossible to import
it using Adminer. (Once you import it, however, you can use either
client to run queries on the data.)</p>
<p>The MySQL command line client is also useful for working on remote
servers, which I&rsquo;ll discuss later in the chapter. After you SSH into a
server on the cloud, you can use the <code>mysql</code> command to connect to the MySQL
service and then run SQL queries there.</p>
<p>The command line client isn&rsquo;t ideal for all tasks. For example, if your
query results include many columns, each line of output might be wider
than your terminal window, causing the output to wrap, which makes it
very difficult to read. Moreover, the command line client displays all
the output in your terminal. If you&rsquo;re
running many queries, it might be cumbersome to scroll back through your
terminal history to find specific results that you ran previously. For
everyday queries, it&rsquo;s easier to use a graphical client like Adminer.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="python-and-mysql">PYTHON AND MYSQL<a class="headerlink" href="#python-and-mysql" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You can also consider writing Python code that interacts with MySQL databases, where your Python script acts as the SQL client. For example, you wrote Python scripts in Chapter 9 that loop through every row in a CSV and then run a block of code; you might want to similarly loop through every row returned in response to a <code>SELECT</code> query. To write Python code that connects to a MySQL database and runs queries, you can use a module called <code>PyMySQL</code>. For Python code that runs SQL queries, the table of data often isn’t displayed—instead, it’s stored in a variable, typically a list of dictionaries that you can loop through. For more information, see the documentation for the <code>PyMySQL</code> module at <a href="https://pymysql.readthedocs.io">https://pymysql.readthedocs.io</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far, you&rsquo;ve seen SQL query results displayed in Adminer as HTML
tables. If you run the same queries using the <code>mysql</code> client, the data will be displayed as
text in your terminal. You&rsquo;ll test this in Exercise 12-3.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-12-3-install-and-test-the-command-line-mysql-client">Exercise 12-3: Install and Test the Command Line MySQL Client<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-12-3-install-and-test-the-command-line-mysql-client" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In this exercise, you&rsquo;ll install and practice using the MariaDB command
line client <code>mysql</code>, which has
the same name and works in the same way as the official MySQL client.</p>
<p>Start by opening a terminal. If you&rsquo;re using a Mac, install it in
Homebrew by running this command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>mariadb
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you&rsquo;re using Linux or Windows with WSL, install it by running this
command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>mariadb-client
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can now use the <code>mysql</code>
command to connect to your MySQL database. To do so, run the following
command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>mysql<span class="w"> </span>-h<span class="w"> </span>localhost<span class="w"> </span>--protocol<span class="o">=</span>tcp<span class="w"> </span>-u<span class="w"> </span>root<span class="w"> </span>-p
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>-h</code> argument (short for
<code>--host</code>) tells the client the
IP address or hostname of the MySQL server to which you want to connect.
In this case, the hostname is
<code>localhost</code>, since the server
is running locally on your computer. The <code>--protocol``=tcp</code> argument tells the MySQL client to
connect to the server over the network, which is required when you&rsquo;re
running the server in a Docker container. The <code>-u</code> argument (short for <code>--user</code>) tells the client that you&rsquo;re logging
in as the root user, in this case. Finally, <code>-p</code> (short for <code>--password</code>) tells the client that this user is
protected with a password.</p>
<p>After you run the <code>mysql</code>
command, press <strong>ENTER</strong>. The MySQL client should prompt you to
type the root user&rsquo;s password:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Enter password:
</code></pre></div>

<p>Once you enter the correct password, you should end up in the MySQL
shell:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Welcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.

</code></pre></div>

<p>From here, you can run all the same SQL queries you did in Adminer.
However, to work in the command line client, you&rsquo;ll need to know a few
additional queries.</p>
<h3 id="mysql-specific-queries">MySQL-Specific Queries<a class="headerlink" href="#mysql-specific-queries" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Queries like <code>INSERT</code> and
<code>SELECT</code> are typically nearly
identical between different versions of SQL, but each version has unique
queries for actions like returning a list of databases in the server or
a list of tables in a database. To navigate around a MySQL server from
the command line client, you&rsquo;ll need to know the following
MySQL-specific queries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>SHOW DATABASES;</code> Shows a list of all of the databases on your MySQL server</p>
<p><code>USE database_name;</code> Switches you into a specific database, so you can start running queries there</p>
<p><code>SHOW TABLES;</code> Shows a list of all of the tables in the currently selected database</p>
<p><code>DESCRIBE TABLE table_name;</code> Shows you the columns in a table</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are other MySQL-specific queries, but these are all you&rsquo;ll need to
know for the purposes of this book.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>Technically, Adminer uses these queries too, but it runs them for you
in the background. When you use the command line client, you have to run
them yourself. For example, when Adminer showed you a list of databases,
it ran <code>SHOW DATABASES</code>; for you in order to find the
list; when you selected the <code>books</code> database, technically
it ran <code>USE books</code>; for you.</em></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s test these queries. Run the following command to list all of the
available databases on your MySQL server:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>MariaDB [(none)]&gt; SHOW DATABASES;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| books              |
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
5 rows in set (0.068 sec)
</code></pre></div>

<p>The result of this query lists all of the databases in this MySQL
server. In this case, it lists the <code>books</code> database you created in Exercise 12-1
and the four databases that come with MySQL by default.</p>
<p>Switch to the <code>books</code>
database:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>MariaDB [(none)]&gt; USE books;
Reading table information for completion of table and column names
You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A

Database changed
MariaDB [books]&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<p>After you run <code>USE books;</code>,
the prompt should change from <code>MariaDB [(none)]&gt;</code> to <code>MariaDB [books]&gt;</code>, letting you know which database is
currently selected. When you run normal SQL queries with verbs like
<code>SELECT</code> or <code>INSERT</code>, they&rsquo;ll run in the currently selected
database.</p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve selected a database, list all of its tables with the
following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>MariaDB [books]&gt; SHOW TABLES;
+-----------------+
| Tables_in_books |
+-----------------+
| authors         |
| books           |
+-----------------+
2 rows in set (0.025 sec)
</code></pre></div>

<p>This database has two tables, <code>authors</code> and <code>books</code>. List all of the columns in the
<code>books</code> table:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>MariaDB [books]&gt; DESCRIBE books;
+-----------+---------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field     | Type    | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+-----------+---------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| id        | int(11) | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| title     | text    | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| author_id | int(11) | NO   | MUL | NULL    |                |
+-----------+---------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
3 rows in set (0.023 sec)
</code></pre></div>

<p>This displays a table of data with each row representing a different
column in the table that you&rsquo;re describing, including all of the
attributes of each column. For example, you can see that the
<code>id</code> column has the type of
<code>int</code> and is set to
auto-increment.</p>
<p>The queries you just ran return information about the MySQL server
itself&mdash;what databases it contains, what tables those databases
contain, and what columns are in each table. You can also query for the
data stored in the database itself. For example, try running the
following query to get a list of all of the books stored in the
<code>books</code> table:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>MariaDB [books]&gt; SELECT * FROM books;
+----+-------------------------------+-----------+
| id | title                         | author_id |
+----+-------------------------------+-----------+
|  1 | Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations |         1 |
|  2 | Pale Blue Dot                 |         2 |
|  3 | Contact: A Novel              |         2 |
+----+-------------------------------+-----------+
3 rows in set (0.012 sec)
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can run any of the queries that you ran in Adminer using the CLI
client, and the rows will be displayed in your terminal.</p>
<p>At any point, you can run <code>exit</code> to quit:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>MariaDB [(books)]&gt; exit
Bye
</code></pre></div>

<p>This will drop you back into your terminal.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve made it through the crash course on SQL and are ready to start
tackling real data! In the rest of the chapter, you&rsquo;ll learn more about
Epik and its massive data breach, then download and analyze a MySQL
database backup from the Epik dataset.</p>
<h3 id="the-history-of-epik">The History of Epik<a class="headerlink" href="#the-history-of-epik" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Epik, a Seattle-area company founded by Rob Monster in 2009, has long
provided domain name and web hosting services to neo-Nazi and far-right
websites. Its customers have included the notorious neo-Nazi website
the Daily Stormer, the conspiracy website
InfoWars, the Proud Boys hate group, and the Oath Keepers right-wing
militia, which you learned about in Chapter 6. After Gab moved to Epik, Monster baselessly
claimed that much of the hate speech on Gab was posted by liberals who
wanted to make the service look bad.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in this chapter&rsquo;s introduction, in October 2018, Robert
Bowers posted a message to Gab shortly before committing the deadliest
antisemitic terrorist attack in US history. GoDaddy deplatformed Gab, so
it moved its domain hosting service to Epik. This wasn&rsquo;t the only time
that Epik helped save a far-right platform that was getting deplatformed
after a mass shooting.</p>
<p>In addition to helping save Gab, Epik started hosting the domain name
for the far-right message board then known as 8chan (now rebranded as
8kun) after a similar mass shooting in 2019. Patrick Crusius posted a
manifesto to 8chan shortly before killing 23 people and injuring 23 more
in a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, the deadliest anti-Latino terrorist
attack in recent US history. Crusius&rsquo;s manifesto also spouted the &ldquo;great
replacement&rdquo; conspiracy theory. After the attack, Cloudflare suspended
8chan&rsquo;s service, but Epik was there to quickly bring the site back
online.</p>
<p>Epik also handled domain hosting for Parler, the social media site
discussed in the previous chapter, after various platforms banned it in
the aftermath of the deadly January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.
Epik has since become a popular domain name registrar for far-right and
conservative websites worried about getting deplatformed. America&rsquo;s
Frontline Doctors, the anti-vaccine disinformation group I discuss in
the following chapter, has also registered its domains with Epik, though
it&rsquo;s not at risk of being deplatformed.</p>
<p>In this section, you&rsquo;ll learn about the history and motivation behind
the Epik hack and the type of information this dataset contains.</p>
<h4 id="the-epik-hack">The Epik Hack<a class="headerlink" href="#the-epik-hack" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>On September 1, 2021, less than a year before the US Supreme Court&rsquo;s
2022 decision to overturn the constitutional right to abortion, the
state of Texas passed the most restrictive abortion law in the US&mdash;more
restrictive, at the time, than any law passed since the 1973 Supreme
Court decision Roe v. Wade. The Texas Heartbeat Act banned abortions six
weeks after pregnancy, before many people even realize they&rsquo;re pregnant.
The law is enforced by civil lawsuits: any member of the public who
believes in forced birth can sue anyone who performs or facilitates
abortions, creating a chilling effect for reproductive health care.</p>
<p>An anti-abortion lobbyist group quickly set up a website by the name
ProLifeWhistleblower.com, inviting the public to anonymously submit
private details about people they believed were obtaining or
facilitating abortions. GoDaddy kicked the group off its platform,
citing a violation of its terms of service, so the site switched its
domain hosting to Epik. Epik soon caved to public pressure and likewise
stopped providing service, but this was enough to catch the attention of
hackers.</p>
<p>In September and October of 2021, in a series
of hacks dubbed Operation Epik Fail, hackers identifying with Anonymous
hacked Epik incredibly thoroughly, releasing hundreds of gigabytes of
data on BitTorrent. DDoSecrets downloaded a copy of this data, added it
to its leak archive, and also made it accessible to download from its
public data server, rather than just using BitTorrent. Most data
breaches expose a database, a collection of email, or a cache of
documents. This breach included all of these, along with bootable disk
images from Epik&rsquo;s servers&mdash;essentially, the entire hard disks that
powered its servers. You could use bootable disk images to run a
snapshot of Epik&rsquo;s complete servers in a virtual machine. With some
work, this would allow you to rifle through <em>everything</em> hosted on these
servers.</p>
<p>The hackers published their leaks in three parts over the course of four
weeks. In a press release accompanying the first data leak (see Figure
12-7), they announced that they had released
&ldquo;a decade&rsquo;s worth of data&rdquo; from Epik. &ldquo;This dataset is all that&rsquo;s needed
to trace the actual ownership and management of the fascist side of the
Internet that has eluded researchers, activists, and, well, just about
everybody,&rdquo; the press release continued.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 12-7: The top of the !README.TXT file included in the dataset, written by the Epik hackers" src="media/images/Figure12-7.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 12-7: The top of the <code>!README.TXT</code> file included in the dataset, written by the Epik hackers</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true: the Epik dataset includes 10 years of data from the company,
including all of the data from nine MySQL databases. These databases
include tables full of customers of various Epik products, like their
domain name registrar; their service that protects websites against
attacks, called BitMitigate; and their VPN service, called Anonymize.
The databases also include information about domain name purchases,
email forwarding for these domains, credit card transactions, customers&rsquo;
passwords, and more.</p>
<p>The most important data in the Epik dataset, in
my opinion, is the WHOIS privacy data containing information on the
owners behind the domain names Epik hosts.</p>
<h4 id="epiks-whois-data">Epik’s WHOIS Data<a class="headerlink" href="#epiks-whois-data" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p><em>WHOIS</em> (pronounced &ldquo;who is&rdquo;) data is the public ownership information
you&rsquo;re required to provide when buying a domain name. This generally
includes contact details like names, email addresses, phone numbers, and
physical addresses, along with the domain&rsquo;s registrant contact,
administrative contact, and technical contact (in many cases, the same
person plays all three roles). Which organization keeps track of WHOIS
records depends on the domain name in question, but the records are all
public. A quick internet search should turn up plenty of online services
that allow you to look up WHOIS data for any given domain. The
<code>whois</code> command line tool also
lets you look up WHOIS data from a terminal.</p>
<p>Public WHOIS data creates a major privacy issue, since it allows anyone
to easily discover not only the owner of a domain but also their PII. To
combat this, many domain registrars offer WHOIS privacy services, where
they&rsquo;ll put their own information in the WHOIS record or just replace
the owner name with something like REDACTED FOR PRIVACY on their
customers&rsquo; behalf.</p>
<p>Epik runs a WHOIS privacy service, hiding the ownership information of
many far-right domain names from the public. But the Epik dataset
includes that hidden information. As long as a domain name was
registered on Epik before September 2021, when the hack occurred, you
can use this dataset to look up its true owners.</p>
<p>You can find the WHOIS ownership data associated with any domain name
simply by running <code>whois</code>
<code>domain_name</code> in a
terminal. This command will look up the public information, meaning that
if a domain uses a WHOIS privacy service, you won&rsquo;t get to see who
actually owns it. For example, you would run the following command to
find the ownership information about the Oath Keepers domain name,
oathkeepers.org:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>whois<span class="w"> </span>oathkeepers.org
</code></pre></div>

<p>When I ran this command, I got the following output:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>--snip--

--snip--
</code></pre></div>

<p>Public WHOIS data told me that oathkeepers.org was first registered on
March 1, 2009; it expires in 2032; and its current registrar was Epik.
However, all the contact information for the person who registered it
was listed as <code>REDACTED FOR PRIVACY</code>, effectively hiding the domain
ownership information from the public.</p>
<p>If you search the Epik dataset for this domain name, however, as you&rsquo;ll
learn to do later in this chapter, you can find all the redacted site
ownership details. When I searched the dataset, I found that the
oathkeepers.org registrant organization is Oath Keepers, and the
registrant name is Stewart Rhodes. As noted in Chapter 6, Rhodes is the Oath Keepers founder who was
convicted of seditious conspiracy for his role in the January 6, 2021,
attack and subsequently sentenced to 18 years in prison. The dataset
also includes Rhodes&rsquo; phone number, email address, and a physical
address in Granbury, Texas.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the administrator and technical contacts for this domain
lists the company eJam Systems LLC, along with the name Edward Durfee,
an email address at ejamsystems.com, a phone number, and a home address
in Northvale, New Jersey. eJam Systems LLC appears to be a right-wing
company, run by Edward Durfee, that did tech work for the Oath Keepers.
None of this information was available in the WHOIS records, but now
it&rsquo;s all public, thanks to the Epik hack. If you check out the email in
the <em>sentmail648</em> folder you imported in Chapter 6, you&rsquo;ll find messages from the address
<em>oksupport@oathkeepers.org</em> all signed by Edward Durfee, IT Support.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>In Chapter 1, I discussed not revealing unnecessary
PII. In this case, I believe that publishing Durfee&rsquo;s name, the city he
lives in, and the name of his company is in the public interest. Since
he&rsquo;s an organizer for the Oath Keepers, a group that attempted to
subvert democracy, this makes him a legitimate target of reporting.
There&rsquo;s no public interest in publishing his home address, phone number,
or email address, though.</em></p>
<p>After the Epik hack, reporter Mikael Thalen wrote an article for the
Daily Dot based on the leaked WHOIS data and focusing on Ali Alexander,
one of the primary organizers on January 6 and a major activist in the
Stop the Steal movement. Thalen used the Epik data to show that in the
days following the riot, Alexander began turning on WHOIS privacy for
over 100 domains he owned, nearly half of them connected to the election
lie, such as stopthestealmovement.com and stopthestealnews.com. You can
read Thalen&rsquo;s reporting at
<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/ali-alexander-epik-hack-web-domains-capitol-riot/">https://www.dailydot.com/debug/ali-alexander-epik-hack-web-domains-capitol-riot/</a>.</p>
<p>In Exercise 12-4, you&rsquo;ll download part of the Epik dataset and get ready
to start exploring it yourself.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-12-4-download-and-extract-part-of-the-epik-dataset">Exercise 12-4: Download and Extract Part of the Epik Dataset<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-12-4-download-and-extract-part-of-the-epik-dataset" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The Epik dataset is split into three folders: <em>EpikFail</em>,
<em>EpikFailTheB:Sides</em>, and <em>EpikFailYouLostTheGame,</em> which you can
download either using BitTorrent or from DDoSecrets&rsquo; public data server
at
<a href="https://data.ddosecrets.com/Epik/">https://data.ddosecrets.com/Epik/</a>.
Inside the first folder, <em>EpikFail</em>, are three subfolders: <em>emails</em>,
<em>filesystems</em>, and <em>sql</em>. The <em>emails</em> folder contains email messages
from a single email account related to Epik, while the <em>filesystems</em>
folder contains all of the files taken from one of Epik&rsquo;s Linux servers.
The <em>sql</em> folder, by far the largest folder in the first part of the
Epik dataset, contains backups of MySQL databases. For this exercise,
you&rsquo;ll download a single MySQL backup file, <em>api_system.sql.gz</em>, which
takes only 1.2GB of disk space.</p>
<p>On your <em>datasets</em> USB disk, create a new folder called <em>Epik</em> for the
Epik dataset, and then download <em>api_system.sql.gz</em> from
<a href="https://data.ddosecrets.com/Epik/EpikFail/sql/api_system.sql.gz">https://data.ddosecrets.com/Epik/EpikFail/sql/api_system.sql.gz</a>
and save it there. Now, open a terminal (if you&rsquo;re in Windows, use an
Ubuntu terminal) and change to the <em>Epik</em> folder on your <em>datasets</em> USB
disk like so:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>micah@trapdoor ~ % cd /Volumes/datasets/Epik
micah@trapdoor Epik % ls -lh
total 0
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff   1.2G Sep 17  2021 api_system.sql.gz
</code></pre></div>

<p>The file is a compressed backup of a MySQL database with the extension
<em>.sql.gz</em>, meaning that it was compressed using GZIP discussed in
Chapter 11. To extract the
<em>api_system.sql.gz</em> file, run the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>gunzip<span class="w"> </span>api_system.sql.gz
</code></pre></div>

<p>SQL data compresses very well: the original <em>api_system.sql.gz</em> file is
1.2GB, but the extracted version, <em>api_system.sql</em>, is 20GB, taking up
16 times as much disk space.</p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve extracted the file, the next step is to import it into
your MySQL database in Exercise 12-5.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-12-5-import-epik-data-into-mysql">Exercise 12-5: Import Epik Data into MySQL<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-12-5-import-epik-data-into-mysql" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The Epik dataset includes nine separate MySQL databases. To keep things
simple, the exercises in this chapter require you to import and explore
data only in the <em>api_system.sql</em> database into your MySQL server. Each
<em>.sql</em> file in the Epik dataset represents a full database containing
several tables. In order to import one of these
files into MySQL, first you&rsquo;ll need to create a database for it.</p>
<h4 id="create-a-database-for-api_system">Create a Database for api_system<a class="headerlink" href="#create-a-database-for-api_system" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You&rsquo;ll use the <code>mysql</code> command
line client to create a new database called
<code>epikfail_api_system</code>.
Prefixing your database title with <code>epikfail_</code> will help you keep it separate from
other databases you might import in the future.</p>
<p>Open a terminal and run the following command to connect to your MySQL
server as the root user:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>micah@trapdoor ~ % mysql -h localhost --protocol=tcp -u root -p
Enter password:
Welcome to the MariaDB monitor. Commands end with ; or \g.
--snip--
</code></pre></div>

<p>After logging in with the root password, run this command to create the
<code>epikfail_api_system</code>
database:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>MariaDB [(none)]&gt; CREATE DATABASE epikfail_api_system;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.015 sec)
MariaDB [(none)]&gt; exit
Bye
</code></pre></div>

<p>Congrats, you&rsquo;ve just created a new database!</p>
<h4 id="import-api_system-data">Import api_system Data<a class="headerlink" href="#import-api_system-data" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The simplest way to import a MySQL backup into a MySQL client is to pipe
the data into the <code>mysql</code>
program, by running the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>cat<span class="w"> </span>filename.sql<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>mysql<span class="w"> </span>-h<span class="w"> </span>localhost<span class="w"> </span>--protocol<span class="o">=</span>tcp<span class="w"> </span>-u<span class="w"> </span>root<span class="w"> </span>-p<span class="w"> </span>database_name
</code></pre></div>

<p>The problem is that you&rsquo;d see no output&mdash;no progress bars or any other
indication that it&rsquo;s actually working. This is fine for small SQL
backups that take a few seconds to import, but it might take hours or
days to import large backups. To solve this problem, I use a simple
program called <code>pv</code>, which
stands for &ldquo;Pipe Viewer,&rdquo; to display a progress bar. The <code>pv</code> command is similar to the
<code>cat</code> command, but it also
displays useful output so you can be sure your command is running.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using a Mac, install <code>pv</code> in Homebrew by running the following
command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>pv
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you&rsquo;re using Linux or Windows with WSL, install <code>pv</code> by running the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>pv
</code></pre></div>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve installed <code>pv</code>, make sure you&rsquo;re in the <em>Epik</em> folder
and run this command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>pv<span class="w"> </span>api_system.sql<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>mysql<span class="w"> </span>-h<span class="w"> </span>localhost<span class="w"> </span>--protocol<span class="o">=</span>tcp<span class="w"> </span>-u<span class="w"> </span>root<span class="w"> </span>-p<span class="w"> </span>epikfail_api_system
</code></pre></div>

<p>Just like <code>cat</code>, <code>pv</code> should load data from
<em>api_system.sql</em> and pipe it into <code>mysql</code>, but this time it should show you a
progress bar like this one, complete with the import speed and the
estimated time that it will finish:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>micah@trapdoor Epik % pv api_system.sql | mysql -h localhost --protocol=tcp -u root -p
epikfail_api_system
Enter password:
2.89GiB 0:33:47 [587KiB/s] [=====&gt;                    ] 14% ETA 3:14:56
</code></pre></div>

<p>In this example, I had been running the import for 33 minutes and 47
seconds. It had progressed through 2.89GB of the data (14 percent) and
estimated it would finish in 3 hours and 15 minutes, at a current speed
of 587KB per second (though import speed varies greatly depending on
which query is currently running). It took me a total of four hours to
import <em>api_system.sql</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="troubleshooting-during-database-imports">TROUBLESHOOTING DURING DATABASE IMPORTS<a class="headerlink" href="#troubleshooting-during-database-imports" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Something can always go wrong while you’re in the middle of importing a database. You could accidentally close your terminal window, stopping the import partway through. Your laptop could run out of battery, or you could accidentally unplug your USB disk. You might need to cancel the import midway through (by pressing CTRL-C). If anything like this happens, don’t worry. It’s fairly simple to delete your database, create a new one, and start the import over again. Unfortunately, though, you can’t continue where you left off.</p>
<p>To restart an interrupted import, you can drop the database using the <code>DROP DATABASE database_name;</code> statement. This deletes the whole database and all of its tables. Create a new database and import the data again. For example, if your <code>epikfail_api_system</code> import was interrupted, you start over by running these MySQL queries as the root user with the following commands:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">DROP</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">DATABASE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">epikfail_api_system</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">CREATE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">DATABASE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">epikfail_api_system</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then start the import again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait for the data from <em>api_system.sql</em> to finish importing before you
move on to the next section. (It&rsquo;s possible to run queries on the
database before it&rsquo;s fully imported, but you&rsquo;ll only get results from
the data that&rsquo;s been imported so far.)</p>
<h3 id="exploring-epiks-sql-database">Exploring Epik’s SQL Database<a class="headerlink" href="#exploring-epiks-sql-database" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Once <em>api_system.sql</em> has finished importing, it&rsquo;s time to dive in and
take a look at the <code>epikfail_api_system</code> database. With databases like this, a
good tactic is to manually view each table and try to determine if it
contains data worth exploring further. To begin my investigation, I
looked at the first rows in each of the 49 tables in
<code>epikfail_api_system</code>,
starting with the <code>backorder</code>
table and ending with the <code>whoisxmlapi_cache</code> table. I tried to get a sense of what
information that table held, if it was related to other tables in the
database, and how many rows of data there were.</p>
<p>In this section, I&rsquo;ll guide you through the tables that stood out to me
in the <code>epikfail_api_system</code>
database. You can use either Adminer or the <code>mysql</code> command line client: they both query
the same SQL server and will receive the same tables of data in
response. When your interest is piqued, you can try running your own
queries as well. It&rsquo;s good practice to refrain from running
<code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, or <code>DELETE</code> queries in leaked databases that
you&rsquo;re investigating. However, <code>SELECT</code> queries don&rsquo;t modify anything in the
database, so you can run as many as you want at any point, then continue
following along when you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<h4 id="the-domain-table">The domain Table<a class="headerlink" href="#the-domain-table" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The <code>domain</code> table in the
<code>epikfail_api_system</code> database
has over 1.6 million rows in it and is clearly a list of domain names in
Epik&rsquo;s system. Count the number of rows in this table using the
following query:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">COUNT</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">domain</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Table 12-12 shows the results from that query.</p>
<p><em>Table 12-12: Counting the Rows in the <code>domain</code> Table</em></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><code>COUNT(*)</code></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1688005</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Columns in the <code>domain</code> table
include <code>id</code>, <code>name</code> (the domain name, in all caps),
<code>cr_date</code> (presumably the
domain name&rsquo;s creation date), and <code>exp_date</code> (presumably the domain name&rsquo;s
expiration date).</p>
<p>To look at the 10 most recently created domains in this table, run the
following query:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">cr_date</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">exp_date</span>
<span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">domain</span>

<span class="k">LIMIT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This command uses the
<code>ORDER BY cr_date DESC</code> clause
to sort data returned by the <code>cr_date</code> column, in descending order (from most
recent to oldest, in this case). The <code>LIMIT 10</code> clause in the following line limits
the results to only 10 rows; if you left that clause out, the command
would return all 1.6 million rows.</p>
<p>Table 12-13 shows the results from this query.</p>

<p>To search the list of Epik domains for ones containing specific
keywords, use the <code>LIKE</code>
operator in the <code>WHERE</code>
clause. For example, try using the following queries to search for
domains that mention the word <em>Trump</em>, ordered by the most recently
created domains:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">cr_date</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">exp_date</span>
<span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">domain</span>
<span class="k">WHERE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">LIKE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;%trump%&#39;</span>
<span class="k">ORDER</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">BY</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">cr_date</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">DESC</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>As you learned earlier, using <code>LIKE</code> makes the search case insensitive, and
<code>%</code> characters are wildcards.
Filtering the results by <code>name LIKE '%trump%'</code> will display only results that include
<em>trump</em> (regardless of capitalization) somewhere in their name.</p>
<p>The query returns 413 results total. Table 12-14 shows the first 10 results.</p>
<p>Clearly, many people used Epik to register Trump-related domain names.
These results don&rsquo;t include any ownership information for these domains,
though. To find that missing information, let&rsquo;s take a look at the
<code>privacy</code> table.</p>

<h4 id="the-privacy-table">The privacy Table<a class="headerlink" href="#the-privacy-table" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The <code>privacy</code> table has
721,731 rows of data. Like the <code>domain</code> table, it has a <code>domain</code> column that lists domain names, but it
also includes columns with all of the private WHOIS details. Relevant
columns include <code>admin_org</code>,
<code>admin _name</code>,
<code>admin_email</code>,
<code>admin_address</code>,
<code>admin_phone</code>, and other
similar information. There are also numerous similar columns with
<code>tech_</code>, <code>bill_</code>, and <code>reg_</code> prefixes. The data in this table
includes WHOIS data for the administrator contact, the technical
contact, the billing contact, and the registrant contact. There&rsquo;s also a
<code>date_add</code> column with a
timestamp, presumably noting when this domain was added to Epik&rsquo;s
system.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that, in 2019, Patrick Crusius posted a manifesto to
8chan before killing 23 people and injuring 23 more in El Paso, Texas.
In the aftermath of the terrorist attack, 8chan moved its domain name
hosting to Epik. With that in mind, search the data for 8chan.co,
8chan&rsquo;s domain name, to see who is behind the site:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">privacy</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">WHERE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">domain</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;8CHAN.CO&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Table 12-15 shows partial results from this
query. The query selects all columns (<code>*</code>), but I included only the
<code>admin_</code> columns here because
the <code>tech_</code>, <code>bill_</code>, and <code>reg_</code> columns all have the exact same data
that appears in the <code>admin_</code>
column.</p>
<p>This domain was added to Epik&rsquo;s system the night of August 4, 2019. This
was the day after Crusius posted his manifesto to 8chan and then went on
his anti-Latino murder spree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s public knowledge that Jim Watkins and his son, Ron Watkins, ran
8chan at the time (they are also behind today&rsquo;s rebrand, 8kun).
According to the HBO documentary miniseries <em>Q: Into the Storm</em>,
directed and produced by Cullen Hoback, the pair are also by far the
most likely people behind the QAnon conspiracy cult. Jim Watkins, an
American, lived in the Philippines at the time of
Crusius&rsquo;s rampage. As you can see from the hidden WHOIS data, the admin
address is for a property in the Philippines. This increases confidence
that the data is authentic, and also gives key data points about Jim
Watkins in case we wanted to research him further: an address and phone
number.</p>
<p><em>Table 12-15: Ownership Data for the Domain 8chan.co</em></p>
<ul>
<li><code>id</code>: 2429814</li>
<li><code>domain</code>: 8CHAN.CO</li>
<li><code>date_add</code>: 2019-08-04 23:01:11</li>
<li><code>admin_org</code>: Loki Technology, Incorporated</li>
<li><code>admin_name</code>: Jim Watkins</li>
<li><code>admin_email</code>: domains@nttec.com</li>
<li><code>admin_address</code>: <em>redacted</em></li>
<li><code>admin_city</code>: Pasig</li>
<li><code>admin_state</code>: NCR</li>
<li><code>admin_zip</code>: 1600</li>
<li><code>admin_country</code>: PH</li>
<li><code>admin_cc</code>: PH</li>
<li><code>admin_phone</code>: <code>+63</code><em>redacted</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Since Watkins runs a website popular among American terrorists and is
likely one of the people behind QAnon, the next logical step is to check
if he or his company, Loki Technology, owned any other domain names on
Epik. To find out, try running this query in the
<code>epikfail_api_system</code>
database:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">privacy</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">WHERE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">admin_email</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;domains@nttec.com&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This query searches for domains that list <code>admin_email</code> as <code>domains@nttec.com</code>, which is the administrator email
address on 8chan.co. However, it returns just a single row for that
domain. Run the following query, modified with the expression
<code>admin_email LIKE '%@nttec.com'</code> to check for domains where
<code>admin_email</code> is any email
address at the nttec.com domain:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">privacy</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">WHERE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">admin_email</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">LIKE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;%@nttec.com&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>However, this query has the same results. For your next query, switch
tactics and search for domains that list <code>admin_org</code> as anything mentioning Loki
Technology, using the <code>admin_org LIKE '%Loki Technology%'</code> expression. The expression includes
wildcard characters, just in case Watkins listed his company slightly
differently on different domains, like &ldquo;Loki Technology, Inc.&rdquo; instead
of &ldquo;Loki Technology, Incorporated&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">privacy</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">WHERE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">admin_org</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">LIKE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;%Loki Technology%&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This query returns the same result. For a final
query, search the domains that list <code>admin_name</code> as <code>Jim Watkins</code>, using <code>LIKE</code> to make the search case insensitive:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">privacy</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">WHERE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">admin_name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">LIKE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;Jim Watkins&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Unfortunately, all these queries return just one result: the 8chan.co
row.</p>
<p>In the next section, you&rsquo;ll learn about how I eventually found more
information about domains owned by Jim Watkins in the Epik dataset, just
not in the <code>epikfail_api_system</code> database. For now, let&rsquo;s look at some
final interesting tables in this database.</p>
<h4 id="the-hosting-and-hosting_server-tables">The hosting and hosting_server Tables<a class="headerlink" href="#the-hosting-and-hosting_server-tables" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The <code>hosting</code> table has 3,934
rows and appears to show websites that Epik actually runs the servers
for, not just the domain name registration. Columns include
<code>domain</code>, <code>cr_date</code>, <code>username</code>, <code>password</code> (in plaintext, though it&rsquo;s not clear
what these usernames and passwords are for), <code>plan</code> (like silver, gold, or platinum),
<code>server_id</code>, and others. Run
the following query to view the most recent rows:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">domain</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">cr_date</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">plan</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">server_id</span>
<span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">hosting</span>
<span class="k">ORDER</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">BY</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">cr_date</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">DESC</span>
<span class="k">LIMIT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Since the query uses the <code>ORDER BY cr_date DESC</code> clause, the results will be sorted
from most recent to oldest. The <code>LIMIT 5</code> clause means the results will include
at most five rows. Table 12-16 shows the
results from this query.</p>

<p>I tried loading several of the domain names in this table in a browser.
Some of them are down, while others appear to be websites for random
businesses. I quickly noticed that the <code>server_id</code> column implies a relationship with
another table. I guessed the related table was most likely the
<code>hosting_server</code> table and
began to run queries on that.</p>
<p>The <code>hosting_server</code> table has only six rows, each a
different server that Epik uses to host websites. Run this query to see
the data in this table:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">api_host</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">login_host</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">login_port</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">username</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">password</span>

<p>The passwords in this table are all in plaintext. In fact, if you load
<em>https://hosting9.epik.com:2083</em>
in Tor Browser, you&rsquo;ll see the login page for cPanel, software that&rsquo;s
used to manage shared web hosting systems like this. The usernames and
passwords in the <code>hosting_server</code> table are likely the credentials to
log in to this cPanel server&mdash;but don&rsquo;t actually try this out. As noted
earlier, it&rsquo;s fine for you to see the passwords scattered across
datasets, but actually attempting to log in to an account with them is
illegal. In any case, Epik has probably changed its passwords since the
data breach.</p>
<p>All of the recent websites in the <code>hosting</code> table have a <code>server_id</code> of <code>23</code>. Check how many websites are hosted on
that server by running a query to join it with the
<code>hosting_server</code> table:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">COUNT</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">hosting</span>
<span class="k">LEFT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">JOIN</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">hosting_server</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">ON</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">hosting_server</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">hosting</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">server_id</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>The result is 1,155, so that&rsquo;s the number of websites the server with ID
23 hosts.</p>
<p>What about the rest of the servers? The quickest way to figure out how
many websites each server hosts is to use a <code>GROUP BY</code> clause, like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">server_id</span><span class="p">,</span>

<p>This query groups by

<p>While there&rsquo;s always more to learn, you should now have the SQL skills
to write powerful queries that can help you quickly find what you&rsquo;re
looking for, even in tables with millions of rows.</p>
<h3 id="working-with-epik-data-in-the-cloud">Working with Epik Data in the Cloud<a class="headerlink" href="#working-with-epik-data-in-the-cloud" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The MySQL databases from Epik contain an overwhelming amount of data
that&rsquo;s useful for extremism research, and only a fraction of that data
is in the <em>api_system.sql.gz</em> backup that you&rsquo;ve imported for this
chapter. Some of the other databases, such as <em>intrust.sql.gz</em>, contain
even more interesting information. If you&rsquo;re curious, I suggest
downloading, importing, and investigating all nine MySQL databases from
the Epik dataset.</p>
<p>Some of these databases would likely take your computer days to finish
importing and would require a large amount of disk space. It&rsquo;s more
convenient to download and work with databases like these on a server in
the cloud rather than on your local computer. To do so, follow these
steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new VPS on a cloud service provider (making sure it has
    plenty of disk space) and SSH into it, like you did in Exercise 4-4.</li>
<li>Use <code>wget</code> to download
    just the compressed database backups, a total of 14GB, from
    <a href="https://data.ddosecrets.com/Epik/EpikFail/sql/">https://data.ddosecrets.com/Epik/EpikFail/sql/</a>.
    Alternatively, using a CLI BitTorrent client, you could download the
    entire first part of the Epik dataset, which is 35GB of data,
    similar to what you did in Exercise 4-5.</li>
<li>Extract the compressed MySQL database backups as you did in Exercise
    12-4. By the time you&rsquo;re done extracting these files, you&rsquo;ll have
    145GB of MySQL backup files.</li>
<li>Install a MySQL server on your VPS. There are various ways of doing
    this, but one option is to install Docker on your VPS and run a
    MySQL server as you did in Exercise 12-3. Since your VPS will be
    running Linux, just make sure to follow the Linux instructions
    there.</li>
<li>Using the command line MySQL client, create nine databases, one for
    each backup file. Next, using <code>pv</code> and <code>mysql</code>, import all nine database
    backups as you did in Exercise 12-5. This
    step will likely take your VPS several days to finish, but since the
    remote server is handling the import, this won&rsquo;t disrupt other work
    on your computer.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are essentially the steps I followed when I investigated the Epik
dataset at The Intercept. The downside to doing this all in the cloud is
that you&rsquo;ll need to pay a monthly bill to your hosting provider for the
server that you&rsquo;re using. However, once you have a remote MySQL server
full of Epik databases, you can use a MySQL client to connect to it and
run queries, which will allow you to analyze hundreds of gigabytes of
leaked databases.</p>
<p>The most useful part of the Epik dataset, in my opinion, is the fact
that you can use it to peel back the curtain behind Epik&rsquo;s WHOIS privacy
service. You did this some in the Exploring Epik&rsquo;s SQL
Database section, but you looked only in the <code>privacy</code> table of the
<code>epikfail_api_system</code>
database. But that isn&rsquo;t the only place where you can find WHOIS privacy
data.</p>
<p>The nine different MySQL databases in the Epik leak appear to have lots
of duplicate data. For example, the <code>epikfail_intrust</code> database has a table called
<code>domains_whois</code> with all of
the same columns as the <code>privacy</code> table. The <code>domains_whois</code> table has 1.4 million rows of data,
roughly twice as many as the <code>privacy</code> table, though many of the rows appear
to contain similar data. In the <code>epikfail_whois</code> database, there&rsquo;s a table called
<code>data</code> with similar columns
and 1.3 million rows of data. All three tables have various duplicates
of the same WHOIS data, so you may want to search them all before
concluding that a domain name ownership isn&rsquo;t in this dataset.</p>
<p>In the Exploring Epik&rsquo;s SQL Database section, you ran some
queries in <code>epiktrust_api_system</code> to find domains that Jim Watkins owns
other than 8chan.co, but they fell short. If you import additional
databases, can you find other domains he owns? When I ran similar
queries in the <code>epikfail_intrust</code> database on the
<code>domains_whois</code> table, which
has more data than the <code>privacy</code> table in the
<code>epiktrust_api_system</code>
database, I got some hits. If you want to run this query yourself,
you&rsquo;ll need to first download and import the <em>intrust.sql</em> database into
your MySQL server.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the query I ran to search the <code>domains_whois</code> table in the
<code>epikfail _intrust</code> database
for domains owned by Jim Watkins&rsquo;s company:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">domains_whois</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">WHERE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">admin_email</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">LIKE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;%@nttec.com&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Table 12-19 lists the truncated results of
this query, showing only some of the columns. As you can see, Jim
Watkins owns all of the domains listed in the results.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the domain 5ch.net loaded a Japanese-language
site called 5channel. When I loaded 2ch.net, it failed with a
&ldquo;connection timed out&rdquo; error from Cloudflare, and when I loaded
bbspink.com, I got an &ldquo;access denied&rdquo; error from Cloudflare saying that
the site blocks connections from the US. I connected to a VPN in Europe
and tried again; this time, it redirected to 5ch.net. If you&rsquo;d like, you
can try the same steps yourself.</p>

<p>As you explore more databases, you&rsquo;ll discover that writing SQL queries
to find what you&rsquo;re looking for takes some trial and error. Sometimes
the results from one query will inform what you should search for
next&mdash;as you&rsquo;ve seen, I used the email that Watkins registered 8chan.co
with to find his other domains, for example. When you don&rsquo;t find what
you&rsquo;re looking for, tweak your queries to make them more broad, or
search a different field that might give you similar information.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In this chapter, you&rsquo;ve learned how to run your own MySQL server on your
computer using Docker containers. You took a crash course in SQL, the
language used to communicate with SQL servers, and were introduced to
Epik, the online service provider for right-wing extremists and American
terrorists who have committed mass murder. Finally, you downloaded a
MySQL database backup from the 2021 Epik Fail dataset, imported it into
your own local MySQL server, and ran SQL queries to begin investigating
it yourself.</p>
<p>This marks the conclusion of Part IV, which has given
you the foundational tools and techniques to explore almost any dataset
you can get your hands on. Part V, the final two
chapters of the book, doesn&rsquo;t include any exercises. Instead, it
describes real data-driven investigations I&rsquo;ve worked on in the past,
shows you what code I wrote and why, and explains exactly how I used the
skills I&rsquo;ve taught you throughout this book to find revelations. I hope
you&rsquo;ll use these case studies as inspiration for your own future
data-driven investigations.</p>
