          <h1>Chapter 3: The Command Line Interface</h1>
          <blockquote>
<p><em>Back in the days of the command-line interface, users were all
Morlocks who had to convert their thoughts into alphanumeric symbols
and type them in, a grindingly tedious process that stripped away all
ambiguity, laid bare all hidden assumptions, and cruelly punished
laziness and imprecision.</em></p>
<p>&mdash;Neal Stephenson, <em>In the Beginning &hellip; Was the Command Line</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like most people, you interface with your computer primarily
via its graphical desktop environment: you move the pointer with your
mouse or trackpad and click icons to run programs and open documents.
Programs open in windows that you can resize, maximize, minimize, and
drag around the screen. You can run various programs at once in separate
windows and switch between them. However, there&rsquo;s an alternative,
incredibly powerful interface you can use to communicate with your
computer and give it instructions: the <em>command line interface (CLI)</em>.</p>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section id="content" data-content="chapter-3">
        <div class="wrapper" id="about-content"><p>Command line interfaces are text-based, rather than graphical,
interfaces to interact with your computer. Instead of clicking on icons,
you enter commands to run programs in a <em>terminal emulator</em> (normally
referred to just as a <em>terminal</em>). After running
a command, you&rsquo;ll typically see text-based output displayed in the
terminal.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you&rsquo;ll learn the basic command line skills you need to
follow along with the rest of this book. Whether you&rsquo;re using Windows,
macOS, or Linux, you&rsquo;ll learn how to install and uninstall software via
the command line, how filepaths work, how to navigate around the folders
on your computer, and how to use text editors. You&rsquo;ll also write your
first <em>shell script</em>, a file containing a series of commands.</p>
<h3>Introducing the Command Line</h3>
<p>To prepare you to start working on the command line, this section
explains some fundamentals: what shells are, how users and paths work in
different operating systems, and the concept of privilege escalation.</p>
<h4>The Shell</h4>
<p>The <em>shell</em> is the program that lets you run text-based commands, while
the terminal is the graphical program that runs your shell. When you
open a terminal and see a blinking text cursor waiting for commands,
you&rsquo;re using a shell. When hackers try to break into a computer, their
initial goal is to &ldquo;pop a shell,&rdquo; or access the text-based interface
that allows them to run whatever commands they want.</p>
<p>All operating systems, even mobile ones like Android and iOS, have
shells. This book focuses on Unix shells, the kind that come with macOS
and Linux (but Windows users can also use them). Most versions of Linux
use a shell called bash, and macOS uses one called zsh. These shells are
very similar, and for the purposes of this book you can think of them as
interchangeable.</p>
<p>Windows, on the other hand, comes with two shells: an older one called
Command Prompt (or <em>cmd.exe</em>) and a newer one called PowerShell. The
<em>syntax</em>&mdash;rules that define what different commands mean&mdash;used by
Windows shells is very different from that used by Unix shells. If
you&rsquo;re a Windows user, you&rsquo;ll primarily work in a Unix shell for the
examples in this book. Setting up your computer to run Linux directly in
Windows will be this chapter&rsquo;s first exercise.</p>
<p>To make your shell do something, such as run a program, you carefully
enter the desired command and then press <strong>ENTER</strong> (or
<strong>RETURN</strong> on Mac keyboards). To quit the shell, enter
<code>exit</code> and press
<strong>ENTER</strong>. Shells are finicky: you need to enter commands using
the correct capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, or they won&rsquo;t
work. Typos usually result in nothing more serious than error messages,
however, and it&rsquo;s easy to go back and fix a mistake in a command. I&rsquo;ll
explain how to do so in the Editing Commands section on page
68.</p>
<h4>Users and Paths</h4>
<p>Although operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux are different
in some ways, they all share basic building blocks, including users and
paths.</p>
<p>All operating systems have <em>users</em>, separate accounts that different
people use to log in to the same computer. Users generally have home
folders, also known as home directories, where their files live. Figure
3-1 shows my terminal in Ubuntu, a popular
Linux distribution.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 3-1: My Ubuntu terminal" src="media/images/Figure3-1.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 3-1: My Ubuntu terminal</em></p>
<p>My username is <em>micah</em> and the name of my Ubuntu computer is <em>rogue</em>.
Your terminal will look different depending on your operating system,
username, and computer name.</p>
<p>All operating systems also have filesystems, the collection of files and
folders available on the computer (you got a brief introduction to
filesystems in Chapter 1 while encrypting
your USB disk). In a filesystem, each file and folder has a <em>path</em>,
which you can think of like the location, or address, of that file. For
example, if your username is <em>alice</em>, the path of your home folder in
different operating systems would look as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows: <em>C:\Users\alice</em></li>
<li>macOS: <em>/Users/alice</em></li>
<li>Linux: <em>/home/alice</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Windows filesystems operate differently from macOS or Linux filesystems
in a few key ways. First, in Windows, disks are labeled with letters.
The main disk, where Windows itself is installed, is the <em>C: drive</em>.
Other disks, like USB disks, are assigned other letters. In Windows,
folders in a path are separated with a backslash (<code>\</code>), while other operating systems use
forward slashes (<code>/</code>). In
Linux, paths are case sensitive, but not in Windows and macOS (by
default). For example, in Linux you can store one file called
<em>Document.pdf</em> and another called <em>document.pdf</em> in the same folder. If
you try to do the same in Windows, saving the second file overwrites the
first.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some example paths. If your username is <em>alice</em> and you
download a file called <em>Meeting Notes.docx</em> into the <em>Downloads</em> folder,
here&rsquo;s what that path would look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows: <em>C:\Users\alice\Downloads\Meeting Notes.docx</em></li>
<li>macOS: <em>/Users/alice/Downloads/Meeting Notes.docx</em></li>
<li>Linux: <em>/home/alice/Downloads/Meeting Notes.docx</em></li>
</ul>
<p>When you plug in a USB disk, it&rsquo;s mounted to
different paths for different operating systems. If your disk is labeled
<em>datasets</em>, the path representing the location of that disk might look
as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows: <em>D:</em> (or whatever drive letter Windows decides to mount the
    disk to)</li>
<li>macOS: <em>/Volumes/datasets</em></li>
<li>Linux: <em>/media/alice/datasets</em></li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand how to read paths, since you&rsquo;ll need to
include the location of your dataset or files it contains in the
commands you run.</p>
<h4>User Privileges</h4>
<p>Most users have limited privileges in an operating system. However, the
<em>root user</em> in Linux and macOS and the <em>administrator user</em> in Windows
have absolute power. While <em>alice</em> may not be able to save files into
<em>bob</em>&rsquo;s home folder, for example, the root user has permissions to save
files anywhere on the computer. When a Mac asks you to enter your user
password to change system preferences or install software, or when a
Windows machine asks if you want to allow a program to make changes to
your computer, the operating system is asking for your consent before
switching from your unprivileged user account to the root or
administrator user account.</p>
<p>Most of the time when you&rsquo;re working in a terminal, you run commands as
an unprivileged user. To run a command that requires root (or
administrative) privileges in Linux and macOS, such as to install a new
program, just put <code>sudo</code> in
front of it and press <strong>ENTER</strong>, and you&rsquo;ll be prompted to enter
the password for your regular user account.</p>
<p>As an example, the <code>whoami</code>
command tells you which user just ran a command. On my computer, if I
enter <code>whoami</code> without
<code>sudo</code>, the output is
<code>micah</code>. However, if I enter
<code>sudo whoami</code>, which requires
me to type my password, the output is <code>root</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>micah@rogue:~$ whoami
micah
micah@rogue:~$ sudo whoami
[sudo] password for micah:
root
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you recently ran <code>sudo</code>,
you can run it again for a few minutes without having to re-enter your
password.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong> <em>Be very careful when running commands as root, since running the wrong
commands as the root user can accidentally delete all of your data or
break your operating system. Before using sudo, make sure you have a
clear understanding of what you&rsquo;re about to do.</em></p>
<p>You can use <code>sudo</code> to gain root access only if your
current user has administrator access. If you&rsquo;re the only user on your
computer, you&rsquo;re probably an administrator. To find out, try using
<code>sudo</code> and see whether you get
a &ldquo;permission denied&rdquo; error.</p>
<p>Figure 3-2 shows a comic by Randall Munroe
from his XKCD website that succinctly demonstrates the power of
<code>sudo</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 3-2: Demanding a sandwich with sudo" src="media/images/Figure3-2.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 3-2: Demanding a sandwich with sudo</em></p>
<p>Before learning more command line code, Windows users must install
Ubuntu (see Exercise 3-1). Mac or Linux users can skip to the Basic
Command Line Usage section on page 62.</p>
<h3>Exercise 3-1: Install Ubuntu in Windows</h3>
<p>To work with Ubuntu on a Windows machine, you could install both Windows
and Linux or use a virtual machine within Windows, as mentioned in
Chapter 1. However, for this book&rsquo;s
purposes, it&rsquo;s simplest to use the <em>Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</em>,
a Microsoft technology that lets you run Linux programs directly in
Windows. Opening an Ubuntu window in WSL will, in turn, open a bash
shell and let you install and run Ubuntu software. (Technically, WSL
does use a VM, but it&rsquo;s fast, managed by Windows, and unobtrusive,
running entirely behind the scenes.)</p>
<p>To install WSL, open a PowerShell window as an administrator: click
<strong>Start</strong>, search for <strong>powershell</strong>, right-click <strong>Windows
PowerShell</strong>, choose <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>, and click <strong>Yes</strong>.
Figure 3-3 shows this process, which may look
slightly different depending on your version of Windows.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 3-3: Running PowerShell as an administrator in Windows" src="media/images/Figure3-3.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 3-3: Running PowerShell as an administrator in Windows</em></p>
<p>In your administrator PowerShell window, enter the following command and
press <strong>ENTER</strong>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">wsl</span> <span class="p">-</span><span class="n">-install</span> <span class="n">-d</span> <span class="n">Ubuntu</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This installs the Windows Subsystem for Linux, then downloads and
installs Ubuntu Linux on your computer.</p>
<p>Your screen should now look something like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>PS C :\Windows\system32&gt; wsl --install -d Ubuntu
Installing: Windows Subsystem for Linux
Windows Subsystem for Linux has been installed.
Downloading: WSL Kernel
Installing: WSL Kernel
WSL Kernel has been installed.
Downloading: GUI App Support
Installing: GUI App Support
GUI App Support has been installed.
Downloading: Ubuntu
The requested operation is succession. Changes will not be effective until the
system is rebooted.
PS C:\Windows\system32&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<p>The final line of this output tells you to reboot your computer. Enter
<code>exit</code> and press
<strong>ENTER</strong> (or just close the window) to quit PowerShell, then
reboot. After you log in to Windows again, you should see an Ubuntu
window informing you that the installation may take a few more minutes
to complete. Then the window should present you
with a prompt asking you to create a new user:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Please create a default UNIX user account. The username does not need to match
your Windows username.
For more information visit: https://aka.ms/wslusers
Enter new UNIX username:
</code></pre></div>

<p>Ubuntu needs to keep track of its own users rather than the existing
users on your Windows computer.</p>
<p>With the Ubuntu terminal window in focus, enter a username and press
<strong>ENTER</strong>. The terminal should then prompt you to create a
password:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>New password:
</code></pre></div>

<p>Either use the same password you use to log in to your Windows account
or create a new one and save it in your password manager. Enter your
password and press <strong>ENTER</strong>. While you&rsquo;re typing, nothing will
appear in the Ubuntu terminal.</p>
<p>The terminal should now prompt you to re-enter your new password; do so
and press <strong>ENTER</strong>, which should drop you into an Ubuntu shell
with a prompt and a blinking cursor. My prompt says
<code>micah@cloak:~$</code> because my
username is <em>micah</em> and the name of my Windows computer is <em>cloak</em>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: password updated successfully
Installation successful!
--snip--
micah@cloak:~$
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can now open Ubuntu in your Windows computer. From this point on,
when instructed to open a terminal or run some command line code, use an
Ubuntu terminal window unless I specify otherwise.</p>
<p>From within your Ubuntu shell, you can access your Windows disks in the
<em>/mnt</em> folder. For example, you can access the <em>C:</em> drive in <em>/mnt/c</em>
and the <em>D:</em> drive in <em>/mnt/d</em>. Suppose I download a document using my
web browser and want to access it from Ubuntu. The path to my
<em>Downloads</em> folder in Windows is <em>/mnt/c/Users/micah/Downloads</em>, so the
document would be in that folder. If I want to access the BlueLeaks data
that I downloaded to my USB disk from Ubuntu, then assuming that <em>D:</em> is
the USB disk&rsquo;s drive, the path would be <em>/mnt/d/BlueLeaks</em>.</p>
<p>For more details on using Windows and WSL, including information on
common problems related to using USB disks in WSL, as well as disk
performance issues and various ways to deal with them, check out
Appendix A. Wait until you&rsquo;ve worked through at least Chapter 4 to start implementing these solutions, since
the instructions involve more advanced command line concepts introduced
in that chapter.</p>
<h3>Basic Command Line Usage</h3>
<p>In this section, you&rsquo;ll learn to use the command line to explore files
and folders on your computer. This is a prerequisite to working with
datasets, which are just folders full of files and other folders. You&rsquo;ll
learn how to open a terminal, list files in any folder, distinguish
between relative and absolute paths, switch to different folders in your
shell, and look up documentation on commands from within your terminal.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>When learning command line skills, you can always look things up if you
run into problems&mdash;I still do this every day. You&rsquo;re likely not the
first person to encounter any given command line issue, so with a few
well-worded internet searches, you can find someone else&rsquo;s solution.</em></p>
<h4>Opening a Terminal</h4>
<p>To get started, skip to the subsection for your operating system to
learn how to open a terminal. Throughout this chapter, keep a terminal
open while you&rsquo;re reading to test all the commands.</p>
<h5>The Windows Terminal</h5>
<p>Open the Ubuntu app by clicking <strong>Start</strong> in the bottom-left corner of
the screen, searching for <strong>ubuntu</strong>, and clicking <strong>Ubuntu</strong>.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll use Ubuntu most often for this book, but you may need to open the
native Windows terminals occasionally as well. You can likewise open
PowerShell and Command Prompt by clicking <strong>Start</strong> and searching for
them. Check out the Microsoft program Windows Terminal
(https://aka.ms/terminal),
which lets you open different terminals in different tabs, choosing
between PowerShell, Command Prompt, Ubuntu, and others. If you choose to
install it, you can open it the same way.</p>
<p>Pin the Ubuntu app or Windows Terminal app to your taskbar so you can
quickly open it in the future: right-click its icon and select <strong>Pin to
Taskbar</strong>.</p>
<h5>The macOS Terminal</h5>
<p>Open the Terminal app by opening Finder, going to the <em>Applications</em>
folder, double-clicking the <em>Utilities</em> folder, and double-clicking
<strong>Terminal</strong>. Figure 3-4 shows my macOS
terminal running zsh, the default macOS shell. My username is <em>micah</em>,
and the name of my Mac is <em>trapdoor</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 3-4: My macOS terminal" src="media/images/Figure3-4.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 3-4: My macOS terminal</em></p>
<p>Pin the Terminal app to your dock so you can quickly open it in the
future. To do so, after you open Terminal, press <strong>CTRL</strong> and
click the Terminal icon on your dock, then choose
<strong>Options</strong> ▸ <strong>Keep in Dock</strong>.</p>
<h5>The Linux Terminal</h5>
<p>In most Linux distributions, open the Terminal app by pressing the
Windows key, typing <strong>terminal</strong>, and pressing <strong>ENTER</strong>. If
you&rsquo;re running Ubuntu (or any other Linux distribution that uses the
GNOME graphical environment), pin the Terminal app to your dock so you
can quickly open it in the future. To do so, right-click the Terminal
icon and select <strong>Add to Favorites</strong>.</p>
<h4>Clearing Your Screen and Exiting the Shell</h4>
<p>As you practice using the terminal in the following sections, you&rsquo;ll
sometimes want to start fresh, without having to see all the previous
commands you ran or their output or error messages. Run this simple
command to declutter your terminal:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>clear
</code></pre></div>

<p>This clears everything off the screen, leaving you with nothing but a
blank command prompt. Make sure to do this only if you no longer need to
see the output of your previous commands. (In the Windows Command Prompt
and PowerShell, use <code>cls</code>
instead of <code>clear</code>.)</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re done using the CLI, exit your shell by running this command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">exit</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can also close the terminal window to exit. If you&rsquo;re running a
program when you close the terminal, that program will quit as well.</p>
<h4>Exploring Files and Directories</h4>
<p>When you open a terminal, your shell starts out in your user&rsquo;s home
folder, represented as a tilde (<code>~</code>). The folder you&rsquo;re currently in is
your <em>current working directory</em>, or just <em>working directory</em>. If you
ever forget what directory you&rsquo;re in, run the <code>pwd</code> command (short for &ldquo;print working
directory&rdquo;) to find out.</p>
<p>Running the <code>ls</code> command in
your terminal lists all of the files in your working directory. You can
use this command to check the contents of folders you&rsquo;re working with.
If there are no files or only hidden files, <code>ls</code> won&rsquo;t list anything. To check for
hidden files, modify the <code>ls</code>
command using <code>-a</code> (short for
<code>--all</code>):</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>ls<span class="w"> </span>-a
</code></pre></div>

<p>When you add anything to the end of a command, like <code>-a</code>, you&rsquo;re using a <em>command line
argument</em>. Think of arguments as settings that change how the program
you&rsquo;re running will act&mdash;in this case, by showing hidden files instead
of hiding them.</p>
<p>By default, the <code>ls</code> command
displays files in a format intended to take up as few lines in your
terminal as possible. However, you may want to display one file per line
for easier reading and to get more information about each
file, such as its size, when it was last modified, permissions, and
whether it&rsquo;s a folder. Using the <code>-l</code> argument (short for
<code>--format=long</code>) formats the
output as a list.</p>
<p>You can use both <code>-a</code> and
<code>-l</code> at the same time like so:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>ls<span class="w"> </span>-al
</code></pre></div>

<p>Running this command on my Mac gives me the following output:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>total 8

<p>The first column of this output describes the type of file&mdash;whether
it&rsquo;s a <em>directory</em> (another name for a folder) or an ordinary file&mdash;as
well as the file&rsquo;s permissions. Directories start with <code>d</code>, and ordinary files start with a
hyphen (<code>-</code>). The second
column represents the number of links in the file, which isn&rsquo;t relevant
for the purposes of this book.</p>
<p>The third and fourth columns represent the user and the <em>group</em> that
owns the file. In addition to users, operating systems have groups of
users that can have their own permissions. For example, in Linux, all
users allowed to use <code>sudo</code>
are in the <em>sudo</em> group. If you create or download a file, its user and
group are normally your username. The fifth column is the file size in
bytes. For example, in the file called <em>.zsh_history</em>, my output is
2,773 bytes.</p>
<p>The next three columns of the output represent the time and date when
the file was last modified, and the final column shows the filename.</p>
<p>To see a listing of files in a folder other than the working directory,
add the path to that folder to the end of the <code>ls</code> command. For example, this is how I&rsquo;d
create a listing of files in my <em>code/hacks-leaks-and-revelations</em>
folder, which contains the files released with this book:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>ls<span class="w"> </span>-la<span class="w"> </span>code/hacks-leaks-and-revelations
</code></pre></div>

<p>I&rsquo;d get the following output:</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll download your own copy of these files in Exercise 3-7.</p>
<h4>Navigating Relative and Absolute Paths</h4>
<p>Programs often require you to provide paths to files or folders, usually
when you run a program that works with specific files on your computer.
The path that I passed into <code>ls</code> in the previous section,
<em>code/hacks-leaks-and-revelations</em>, is a <em>relative</em> path, meaning it&rsquo;s
relative to the current working directory, my home folder. Relative
paths can change. For example, if I change my working directory from my
home folder (<em>/Users/micah</em>) to just <em>/Users</em>, the relative path to that
folder changes to <em>micah/code/hacks-leaks-and-revelations</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>absolute</em> path to the <em>code/hacks-leaks-and-revelations</em> folder is
<em>/Users/micah/code/hacks-leaks-and-revelations</em>, which always provides
the location of that folder regardless of my working directory. Absolute
paths start with a forward slash (<em>/</em>), which is also known as the root
path.</p>
<p>You can use two keywords to access relative paths to specific folders:
<code>.</code> (dot), which represents a
relative path to the current folder, and <code>..</code> (dot dot), which represents a relative
path to the <em>parent folder</em> (the folder that contains the current
folder).</p>
<h4>Changing Directories</h4>
<p>The <code>cd</code> command (which stands
for &ldquo;change directory&rdquo;) allows you to change to a different folder. To
change your working directory to the folder, run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>path
</code></pre></div>

<p>For <code>path</code>,
substitute the path to the folder to which you&rsquo;d like to move. You can
use either a relative or an absolute path.</p>
<p>Suppose I&rsquo;m using macOS and have downloaded BlueLeaks to a <em>datasets</em>
USB disk plugged into my machine. After opening a terminal, I can run
the following command to change my working directory
to the <em>BlueLeaks</em> folder, using the absolute path to the folder:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>/Volumes/datasets/BlueLeaks
</code></pre></div>

<p>Alternatively, I can use a relative path to the folder, running the
following command from my home folder:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>../../Volumes/datasets/BlueLeaks
</code></pre></div>

<p>Why does the relative path start with <code>../..</code> in this example? When I open the
terminal, the working directory is my home folder, which in macOS is
<em>/Users/micah</em>. The relative path <code>..</code> would be its parent folder, <em>/Users</em>;
the relative path <code>../..</code>
would be <em>/</em>; the relative path <code>../../Volumes</code> would be <em>/Volumes</em>; and so on.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, the tilde symbol (<code>~</code>) represents your home folder. No
matter what your working directory is, you can run the following to go
back to your home folder:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>~
</code></pre></div>

<p>Use the following syntax to move to a folder inside your home folder:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>~/folder_name
</code></pre></div>

<p>For example, the following command would move you to your <em>Documents</em>
folder:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>~/Documents
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you run <code>ls</code> again after a
<code>cd</code> command, the output
should show you the files in the folder to which you just moved.</p>
<h4>Using the help Argument</h4>
<p>Most commands let you use the argument <code>-h</code>, or <code>--help</code>, which displays detailed instructions
explaining what the command does and how to use it. For example, try
running the following:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>unzip<span class="w"> </span>--help
</code></pre></div>

<p>This command should show instructions on all of the different arguments
that are available to you when using the <code>unzip</code> command, which is used to extract
compressed ZIP files.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the output I got when I ran that command on my Mac:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>UnZip 6.00 of 20 April 2009, by Info-ZIP.  Maintained by C. Spieler.  Send
bug reports using http://www.info-zip.org/zip-bug.html; see README for details.
--snip--
  -p  extract files to pipe, no messages     -l  list files (short format)
  -f  freshen existing files, create none    -t  test compressed archive data
  -u  update files, create if necessary      -z  display archive comment only
  -v  list verbosely/show version info       -T  timestamp archive to latest
  -x  exclude files that follow (in xlist)   -d  extract files into exdir
--snip--
</code></pre></div>

<p>This output briefly describes what each argument for the <code>unzip</code> command does. For example, if you use
the <code>-l</code> argument, the command
shows a list of all of the files and folders inside the ZIP file without
actually unzipping it.</p>
<h4>Accessing Man Pages</h4>
<p>Many commands also have manuals, otherwise known as <em>man pages</em>, which
give more detail about how to use those commands. Run the following to
access a command&rsquo;s man page:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>man<span class="w"> </span>command_name
</code></pre></div>

<p>For example, to read the manual for the <code>unzip</code> command, run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>man<span class="w"> </span>unzip
</code></pre></div>

<p>The output should display a longer explanation of how to use the
<code>unzip</code> command and its
arguments.</p>
<p>Use the up and down arrows and the page up and page down keys to scroll
through the man pages, or press <code>/</code> and enter a term to search. For
example, to learn more details about how the <code>unzip</code> command&rsquo;s <code>-l</code> argument works, press <code>/</code> and enter <code>-l</code>, then press <strong>ENTER</strong>. This
should bring you to the first time <code>-l</code> appears on the man page. Press N to
move on to the next occurrence of your search term.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re finished, press Q to quit the man page.</p>
<h3>Tips for Navigating the Terminal</h3>
<p>This section introduces ways to make working on the command line more
convenient and efficient, along with tips for avoiding and fixing
errors. It also shows how to handle problematic filenames, such as those
with spaces, quotes, or other special characters. A basic understanding
of these concepts will save you a lot of time in the future.</p>
<h4>Entering Commands with Tab Completion</h4>
<p>Shells have a feature called <em>tab completion</em> that saves time and
prevents errors: enter the first few letters of a command or a path,
then press <strong>TAB</strong>. Your shell will fill in the rest if possible.</p>
<p>For example, both macOS and Ubuntu come with a program called hexdump.
In a terminal, enter <code>hexd</code> and
press <strong>TAB</strong>. This should automatically fill in
the rest of the hexdump command. Tab completion also works for paths.
For example, Unix-like operating systems use the <em>/tmp</em> folder to store
temporary files. Enter <code>ls /tm</code>
and press <strong>TAB</strong>. Your shell should add the <code>p</code> to finish typing out the full command.</p>
<p>If you enter only the first couple letters of a command or a path, there
may be more than one way for your shell to complete your line of code.
Assuming that you have both <em>Downloads</em> and <em>Documents</em> folders in your
home folder, type <code>ls ~/Do</code> and
press <strong>TAB</strong>. You&rsquo;ll hear a quiet beep, meaning that the shell
doesn&rsquo;t know how to proceed. Press <strong>TAB</strong> one more time, and it
should display the options, like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Documents/  Downloads/
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you enter a <code>c</code> so that
your command so far is <code>ls ~/Doc</code> and press <strong>TAB</strong>, the command
should complete to <code>ls ~/Documents/</code>. If you enter a <code>w</code> so that your command so far is
<code>ls ~/Dow</code> and press
<strong>TAB</strong>, it should complete to <code>ls ~/Downloads/</code>.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve already typed out the path of a folder, you can also press
<strong>TAB</strong> to list files in that folder, or to automatically complete
the filename if there&rsquo;s only one file in the folder. For example, say I
have my <em>datasets</em> USB disk, on which I&rsquo;ve downloaded BlueLeaks, plugged
into my Ubuntu computer. If I want to change to my <em>BlueLeaks</em> folder, I
can enter the following and press <strong>TAB</strong>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>cd /Vo
</code></pre></div>

<p>This completes the command as follows:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>cd /Volumes/
</code></pre></div>

<p>I press <strong>TAB</strong> again, and my computer beeps and lists the folders
in <em>/Volumes</em>, which in my case are <em>Macintosh HD</em> and <em>datasets</em>. I
enter <code>d</code>, so my command is
<code>cd /Volumes/d</code>, and press
<strong>TAB</strong>, and the shell completes the command as follows:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>cd /Volumes/datasets/
</code></pre></div>

<p>I press <strong>TAB</strong> again. My computer beeps again and lists all of
the files and folders in my <em>datasets</em> USB disk. I enter <code>B</code> (the first letter of BlueLeaks) and
press <strong>TAB</strong>, which gives me:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>cd /Volumes/datasets/BlueLeaks/
</code></pre></div>

<p>Finally, I press <strong>ENTER</strong> to change to that folder.</p>
<h4>Editing Commands</h4>
<p>You can also edit commands. When you start typing a command, you can
press the left and right arrow keys to move the cursor, allowing you to
edit the command before running it. You can also
press <strong>HOME</strong> and <strong>END</strong>&mdash;or, if you&rsquo;re using a Mac
keyboard, <strong>CONTROL</strong>-A and <strong>CONTROL</strong>-E&mdash;to go to the
beginning and end of a line, respectively. You can also cycle between
commands you&rsquo;ve already run using the up and down arrows. If you just
ran a command and want to run it again, or to modify it and then run it,
press the up arrow to return to it. Once you find the command you&rsquo;re
looking for, use the arrow keys to move your cursor to the correct
position, edit it, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong> to run it again.</p>
<p>For example, I frequently get &ldquo;permission denied&rdquo; errors when I
accidentally run commands as my unprivileged user when I should have run
them as root. When this happens, I press the up arrow, then
<strong>CONTROL</strong>-A to go to the beginning of the line, add
<code>sudo</code>, and press
<strong>ENTER</strong> to successfully run the command.</p>
<h4>Dealing with Spaces in Filenames</h4>
<p>Sometimes filenames contain multiple words separated by spaces. If you
don&rsquo;t explicitly tell your shell that a space is part of a filename, the
shell assumes that the space is there to separate parts of your command.
For example, this command lists the files in the <em>Documents</em> folder:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>ls<span class="w"> </span>-lh<span class="w"> </span>~/Documents
</code></pre></div>

<p>Under the hood, your shell takes this string of characters and splits it
into a list of parts that are separated by spaces: <code>ls</code>, <code>-lh</code>, and <code>~/Documents</code>. The first part, <code>ls</code>, is the command to run. The rest of
the parts are the command&rsquo;s arguments. The <code>-lh</code> argument tells the program to display
the output as a list and make the file sizes human-readable. That is, it
will convert the file sizes into units that are easier to read, like
kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes, rather than a large number of
bytes. The <code>~/Documents</code>
argument means you want to list the files in that folder.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to use the same command to list the files in a folder
with a space in its name, like <em>\~/My Documents</em>. You&rsquo;ll run into
problems if you enter this command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>ls<span class="w"> </span>-lh<span class="w"> </span>~/My<span class="w"> </span>Documents
</code></pre></div>

<p>When your shell tries to separate this command into parts, it will come
up with <code>ls</code>, <code>-lh</code>, <code>~/My</code>, and <code>Documents</code>; that is, it sees <em>\~/My Documents</em> as
two separate arguments, <code>~/My</code>
and <code>Documents</code>. It will try
to list the files in the folder <em>\~/My</em> (which doesn&rsquo;t exist), then also
list files in the folder <em>Documents</em>, which isn&rsquo;t what you intended.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, put the name of the folder in quotes:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>ls<span class="w"> </span>-lh<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;~/My Documents&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The shell sees anything within quotes as a single entity. In this case,
<code>ls</code> is the command and its
arguments are <code>-lh</code> followed
by <code>~/My Documents</code>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use a backslash
(<code>\</code>) to <em>escape</em> the space:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>ls<span class="w"> </span>-lh<span class="w"> </span>~/My<span class="se">\ </span>Documents
</code></pre></div>

<p>In the Unix family of operating systems, the backslash is called the
<em>escape character</em>. When the shell parses that string of characters, it
treats an <em>escaped space</em> (<code>\</code>
followed by a space) as a part of the name. Again, the shell reads
<code>ls</code> as the command and
<code>-lh</code> and
<code>~/My Documents</code> as its
arguments.</p>
<h4>Using Single Quotes Around Double Quotes</h4>
<p>You can use the escape character to escape more than spaces. Suppose you
want to delete a filename that has a space <em>and</em> quotes in it, like <em>Say
&ldquo;Hello&rdquo;.txt.</em> You can use the <code>rm</code> command to delete files, but the
following syntax won&rsquo;t work:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>rm<span class="w"> </span>Say<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello&quot;</span>.txt
</code></pre></div>

<p>Your shell will split this command into the words <code>rm</code>, <code>Say</code>, and <code>Hello.txt</code>. You might think you could solve this
by simply adding more quotes</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>rm<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;Say &quot;</span>Hello<span class="s2">&quot;.txt&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>but that won&rsquo;t work either, since you&rsquo;re quoting something that contains
quotes already. Instead, surround the argument with single quotes ('),
like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>rm<span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;Say &quot;Hello&quot;.txt&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Your shell will read this command as <code>rm</code> and the argument as
<code>Say "Hello" .txt</code>, exactly as
you intended.</p>
<p>Avoid putting spaces, quotes, or other troublesome characters in
filenames whenever possible. Sometimes you can&rsquo;t avoid them, especially
when working with datasets full of someone else&rsquo;s files. Tab completion
helps in those cases, allowing you to enter just enough of the filename
so that when you press <strong>TAB</strong>, your shell will fill out the rest
for you. To delete a file in your working directory called <em>Say
&ldquo;Hello&rdquo;.txt</em>, for example, entering <code>rm Sa</code>, then pressing <strong>TAB</strong>,
completes the command to <code>rm Say\ \"Hello\".txt</code> with the correct escape characters
included, so you don&rsquo;t have to provide the proper syntax yourself.</p>
<h3>Installing and Uninstalling Software with Package Managers</h3>
<p>Of the many powerful command line tools that let you quickly work with
datasets, only some come preinstalled; you&rsquo;ll need to install the rest
yourself. While you&rsquo;re likely used to installing software by downloading
an installer from a website and then running it, the command line uses
<em>package</em> <em>managers</em>, programs that let you install,
uninstall, and update software. Nearly all CLI software is free and open
source, so Linux operating systems come with large collections of
software that you can easily install or uninstall with a single command.
Package management projects are also available for macOS (Homebrew) and
Windows (Chocolately).</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using Linux, you likely use a package manager called apt. This
is what the popular Linux operating systems like Ubuntu and Debian use,
as well as all of the Linux distributions based on them (including
Ubuntu in WSL). If your Linux distribution doesn&rsquo;t use apt, you&rsquo;ll need
to look up the package manager documentation for your operating system.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>PACKAGE MANAGEMENT FOR NON-UBUNTU LINUX USERS</h4>
<p>You should be able to follow along with this book no matter what version of Linux you’re using. Several other Debian-based Linux distributions also rely on apt, like Linux Mint, Pop! OS, and others. If you’re using one of these, the apt commands in this book should work, though the names of software packages may be slightly different. If you encounter that issue, run <code>apt search [software_name]</code>
to find the name of the package that you should be installing for your operating system.</p>
<p>If you’re using a version of Linux that doesn’t use apt as its package manager, you’ll need to slightly modify this book’s commands to use your Linux distribution’s package manager. For example, if you’re running Fedora, Red Hat, CentOS, or other similar Linux distributions, you’ll use a package manager called DNF (for older versions of these distributions, the package manager is called yum). See Fedora’s documentation at <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/dnf/">https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/dnf/</a> for more details on using DNF. Arch Linux uses a package manager called pacman (<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman">https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman</a>).</p>
<p>If you’re using a Linux distribution not mentioned here, read your operating system’s package management documentation and learn how to search for, install, uninstall, and update software from the terminal. When you come across an apt command in this book, use your operating system’s package manager software instead. Other Linux commands covered in this book should be the same regardless of your distribution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using a Mac, start with Exercise 3-2 to learn how to use
Homebrew. If you&rsquo;re using Linux or Windows with WSL, skip to Exercise
3-3 to learn how to use apt. This book mostly uses Unix shells and
doesn&rsquo;t cover Chocolately, which installs Windows software instead of
Linux software.</p>
<h3>Exercise 3-2: Manage Packages with Homebrew on macOS</h3>
<p>To install Homebrew, macOS&rsquo;s package manager, open a browser and go to
Homebrew&rsquo;s website at
<a href="https://brew.sh">https://brew.sh</a>,
where you should find the command to install the tool. Copy and paste
the installation command into your terminal and press <strong>RETURN</strong>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>/bin/bash<span class="w"> </span>-c<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="k">$(</span>curl<span class="w"> </span>-fsSL<span class="w"> </span>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh<span class="k">)</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This command uses a program called cURL, which I&rsquo;ll discuss later in
this chapter, to download a shell script from GitHub. It then runs that
script using the bash shell. The script itself uses <code>sudo</code>, meaning that if you enter your
password, it will run commands as root on your computer.</p>
<p>This is what the output looks like on my Mac:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>==&gt; Checking for &#39;sudo&#39; access (which may request your password)...
Password:
</code></pre></div>

<p>Enter the password you use to log in to your Mac and press
<strong>RETURN</strong> to change your status from unprivileged user to root.
No characters will appear in the terminal while you&rsquo;re typing.</p>
<p>After you enter your password, Homebrew should show you a list of paths
for files that it will install. The output should end with the following
message:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Press RETURN to continue or any other key to abort:
</code></pre></div>

<p>Press <strong>RETURN</strong> and wait for Homebrew to finish installing. If
any problems arise, Homebrew will fail and show you an error message.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong> <em>Copying and pasting commands into your terminal can be dangerous: if a
hacker tricks you into running the wrong shell script, they could hack
your computer. Copy and paste commands in your terminal only from
sources you trust.</em></p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve installed Homebrew, you have access to the
<code>brew</code> command, which you can
use to install more software. To check whether Homebrew has a certain
program available to install, run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>brew<span class="w"> </span>search<span class="w"> </span>program_name
</code></pre></div>

<p>For example, Neofetch is a CLI program that displays information about
your computer. To see if it&rsquo;s available in Homebrew, run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>brew<span class="w"> </span>search<span class="w"> </span>neofetch
</code></pre></div>

<p>The output should list the packages that have <em>neofetch</em> in their names
or descriptions; in this case, Neofetch should be listed. Similarly
combine <code>brew search</code> with other program names to check
whether they&rsquo;re available to install.</p>
<p>When you find a package you want to install, run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>program_name
</code></pre></div>

<p>For example, to install Neofetch, run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>neofetch
</code></pre></div>

<p>This should download and install the <code>neofetch</code> tool. Try running it:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>neofetch
</code></pre></div>

<p>Figure 3-5 shows Neofetch running on my Mac.
The figure is black-and-white in print, but if you run the command on
your computer, you should see a rainbow of colors.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 3-5: Running Neofetch on my Mac" src="media/images/Figure3-5.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 3-5: Running Neofetch on my Mac</em></p>
<p>Uninstall programs with the <code>brew uninstall</code> command. For example, run the
following to uninstall Neofetch:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>brew<span class="w"> </span>uninstall<span class="w"> </span>neofetch
</code></pre></div>

<p>To update all programs you&rsquo;ve installed with Homebrew to their latest
versions, run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>brew<span class="w"> </span>upgrade<span class="w"> </span>--greedy
</code></pre></div>

<p>Run <code>brew help</code> to see some examples of how to use this command.</p>
<p>Now that you have a package manager installed, you&rsquo;ll practice using the
command line in Exercise 3-4.</p>
<h3>Exercise 3-3: Manage Packages with apt on Windows or Linux</h3>
<p>You must run most apt commands as root. Before installing or updating
software, make sure your operating system has an up-to-date list of
available software by opening a terminal and running the following:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt<span class="w"> </span>update
</code></pre></div>

<p>When I run that command on my Linux computer, I get this output:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Hit:1 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy InRelease
Hit:2 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-security InRelease

<p>This tells me I have 178 packages that can be upgraded. Run the
following to upgrade your own software:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt<span class="w"> </span>upgrade

<p>Here&rsquo;s the output when I run that command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Reading package lists... Done

Do you want to continue? [Y/n]
</code></pre></div>

<p>Type Y and press <strong>ENTER</strong> to install the updates.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re now ready to install new software. To check whether the package
manager has a certain program available to install, run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>apt<span class="w"> </span>search<span class="w"> </span>program_name
</code></pre></div>

<p>You don&rsquo;t need to use <code>sudo</code> with this search command because it&rsquo;s
not installing or uninstalling anything. However, once you find a
package you want to install, run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>program_name
</code></pre></div>

<p>For example, Neofetch is a CLI program that displays information about
your computer. To see if Neofetch is available in your package manager,
run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>apt<span class="w"> </span>search<span class="w"> </span>neofetch
</code></pre></div>

<p>The output should show a list of packages that have <em>neofetch</em> in their
names or descriptions; in this case, Neofetch should be listed.</p>
<p>To install the <code>Neofetch</code>
tool, run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>neofetch
</code></pre></div>

<p>You should see a list of packages that you must install in order to use
Neofetch. Press Y and then <strong>ENTER</strong> to download and install them
all.</p>
<p>Once installation is complete, try running Neofetch:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>neofetch
</code></pre></div>

<p>Figure 3-6 shows Neofetch running on my Ubuntu
computer. The figure is black-and-white in print, but if you run the
command on your computer, the output should appear in several different
colors.</p>

<em>Figure 3-6: Running Neofetch on my Ubuntu computer</em></p>
<p>Uninstall packages with the <code>sudo apt remove</code> command. For
example, to uninstall Neofetch, run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt<span class="w"> </span>remove<span class="w"> </span>neofetch
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now that you have a package manager installed, you&rsquo;ll practice using the
command line in Exercise 3-4.</p>
<h3>Exercise 3-4: Practice Using the Command Line with cURL</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you&rsquo;ll learn how to determine whether you have a
command installed, download web pages, save the output from a file using
redirection, and view the contents of files directly from the terminal.</p>
<p>The cURL program is a common way to load web pages from the command
line. To load all of the HTML code for the website
<a href="https://www.torproject.org">https://www.torproject.org</a>,
for example, run the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>curl<span class="w"> </span>https://www.torproject.org
</code></pre></div>

<p>To see if cURL is installed, use the <code>which</code> command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>which<span class="w"> </span>curl
</code></pre></div>

<p>If cURL is installed, the output should show you the path where the
program is installed on your computer (something like <em>/usr/bin/curl</em>).
If not, the output should return you to the shell prompt.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have cURL, use your package manager to install it. Enter
<code>sudo apt install curl</code> for
Windows with WSL and Linux machines or <code>brew install curl</code> for Macs. Then run <code>which curl</code> again, and you should see the path to
the cURL program.</p>
<h4>Download a Web Page with cURL</h4>
<p>When you load a web page, your web browser renders a human-readable
version of its content based on the page&rsquo;s HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
code. To see the raw HTML content from the web page hosted at
<em>https://example.com</em>,
run the following command in your terminal:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>curl<span class="w"> </span>example.com
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you load that site in a browser and then view the HTML source by
pressing <strong>CTRL</strong>-U in Windows or Linux, or
⌘-U in macOS, you should see the same HTML code that
this command displays in your terminal.</p>
<p>Some websites are designed to show you text that&rsquo;s easy to read in a
terminal when you access them through cURL, as opposed to showing you
HTML. For example,
<a href="https://ifconfig.co">https://ifconfig.co</a>
will tell you your IP address, geolocate it, and
tell you what country and city it thinks you&rsquo;re in. Try running the
following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>curl<span class="w"> </span>https://ifconfig.co
</code></pre></div>

<p>This should display your IP address. Next, run the following:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>curl<span class="w"> </span>https://ifconfig.co/country
</code></pre></div>

<p>When I run this command, my output is <code>United States</code>. You can try connecting to a VPN
server in another country and then run it again; it should detect your
web traffic as coming from that other country.</p>
<h4>Save a Web Page to a File</h4>
<p>Run the following commands to load
<em>https://example.com</em>
and save it to a file:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>/tmp
curl<span class="w"> </span>https://example.com<span class="w"> </span>&gt;<span class="w"> </span>example.html
</code></pre></div>

<p>The first line of code changes your working directory to <em>/tmp</em>, a
temporary folder where files you store get deleted automatically. The
second line loads
<em>https://example.com</em>,
but instead of displaying the site&rsquo;s contents for you in the terminal,
it redirects them into the file <em>example.html</em> and doesn&rsquo;t display
anything in the terminal.</p>
<p>The <code>&gt;</code> character takes the
output of the command to its left and saves it into the filename to its
right. This is called <em>redirection</em>. Since you changed to the <em>/tmp</em>
folder before running the <code>curl</code> command and the filename you provided
was a relative path, it saved to the file <em>/tmp/example.html</em>.</p>
<p>Run a directory listing to make sure you&rsquo;ve stored the file correctly:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>ls<span class="w"> </span>-lh
</code></pre></div>

<p>This should list all the files in <em>/tmp</em>, which should include a file
called <em>example.html</em>. Try displaying the contents of that file in your
terminal using the <code>cat</code>
command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>cat<span class="w"> </span>/tmp/example.html
</code></pre></div>

<p>The terminal isn&rsquo;t always a good place to view a file&rsquo;s contents. For
example, long lines will wrap, which may make them difficult to
comprehend. In the following section, you&rsquo;ll learn more about the
different types of files and how to work with them more easily in the
command line.</p>
<h3>Text Files vs. Binary Files</h3>
<p>There are many different types of files, but they all fit into one of
two categories: <em>text files</em> and <em>binary files</em>.</p>
<p>Text files are made up of letters, numbers,
punctuation, and a few special characters. Source code, like Python
scripts (discussed in Chapters 7 and
8); shell scripts; and HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript files are all examples of text files. Spreadsheets in CSV
(comma-separated value) format and JSON files (discussed in Chapters
9 and 11,
respectively) are also text files. These files are relatively simple to
work with. You can use the <code>cat</code> command to display text files, as you
did in the previous exercise.</p>
<p>Binary files are made up of data that&rsquo;s more than just letters, numbers,
and punctuation. They&rsquo;re designed for computer programs, not humans, to
understand. If you try to view the contents of a binary file using the
<code>cat</code> command, you&rsquo;ll just see
gibberish. Instead, you must use specialized programs that understand
those binary formats. Office documents like PDFs, Word documents, and
Excel spreadsheets are binary files, as are images (like PNG and JPEG
files), videos (like MP4 and MOV files), and compressed data like ZIP
files.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>The term binary file is technically a misnomer,
because all files are represented by computers as binary&mdash;strings of
ones and zeros.</em></p>
<p>Text files aren&rsquo;t always easy to understand (if you&rsquo;re not familiar with
HTML, viewing it might look like gibberish), but it&rsquo;s at least possible
to display them in a terminal. This isn&rsquo;t true for binary files. For
example, if you try using <code>cat</code> to display the contents of binary
files like PNG images in your terminal, the output will look something
like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>?PNG

IHDR?L??
?D?ؐ???? Pd@?????Y????????u???+?2???ע???@?!N???? ^?K??Eׂ?(??U?N????E??ł??.?ʛ?u_??|?????g?s?ܙ{?@;?
?sQ
 ?x?)b?hK&#39;?/??L???t?+???eC????+?@????L??????/@c@웗7?qĶ?F
                                                        ?L????N??4Ӈ4???!?????
--snip--
</code></pre></div>

<p>Your terminal can&rsquo;t display all of the characters that make up PNG
images, so those characters just don&rsquo;t get displayed. If you want to see
the information stored in a PNG, you need to open it in software that&rsquo;s
designed to view images.</p>
<p>To work with the files in datasets or write shell scripts and Python
code, you&rsquo;ll need a <em>text editor</em>, a program designed to edit text
files. You&rsquo;ll install a text editor in Exercise 3-5 to prepare for
writing your first shell script.</p>
<h3>Exercise 3-5: Install the VS Code Text Editor</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you&rsquo;ll download the free and open source text editor
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and practice using it to view a file.
Download VS Code from
https://code.visualstudio.com
and install it. (If you&rsquo;re already familiar with another text editor,
feel free to keep using that one instead.)</p>
<p>VS Code comes with a command called
<code>code</code> that makes it easy to
open files in VS Code directly from your terminal. Once VS Code is
finished installing, run the following commands:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>curl<span class="w"> </span>https://example.com<span class="w"> </span>&gt;<span class="w"> </span>/tmp/example.html
code<span class="w"> </span>/tmp/example.html
</code></pre></div>

<p>The first line of code saves the HTML from
<em>https://example.com</em>
in the file <em>/tmp/example.html</em>, just like you did in Exercise 3-4. The
second line opens this file in VS Code.</p>
<p>When you open new files and folders in VS Code, it asks whether you
trust each file&rsquo;s author, giving you the option to open the file in
Restricted Mode. For the exercises in this book, you can open files
without using Restricted Mode.</p>
<p>When you open <em>example.html</em>, it should look something like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="cp">&lt;!doctype html&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">html</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">head</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">title</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Example Domain<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">title</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">meta</span> <span class="na">charset</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;utf-8&quot;</span> <span class="p">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">meta</span> <span class="na">http-equiv</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">”Content-type&quot;</span> <span class="na">content</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot;</span> <span class="p">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">meta</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;viewport&quot;</span> <span class="na">content</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;</span> <span class="p">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">style</span> <span class="na">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;text/css&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">body</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
        background-color: #f0f0f2;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Open Sans&quot;,
&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;

    }
--snip--
</code></pre></div>

<p>The output shows the same HTML code that you saw in your terminal when
you ran <code>cat/tmp/example.html</code>
in Exercise 3-4, but this time it should be much easier to read. VS Code
and many other text editors have a feature called <em>syntax highlighting</em>,
where different parts of the file appear in different colors. This makes
it far quicker and easier for your brain to interpret source code, and
also for you to catch mistakes in syntax.</p>
<p>VS Code is highly customizable and includes a wide variety of extensions
that add extra functionality and make the program more pleasant to use.
When you open new types of files, for instance, VS Code might ask if
you&rsquo;d like to install extensions to better support those files.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>To learn more about VS Code&rsquo;s other features, including when to use
Restricted Mode, check out the documentation at
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs">https://code.visualstudio.com/docs</a>.</em></p>
<p>Now that you have some experience running
commands in a shell and have set up a text editor, you&rsquo;ll write your
first shell script in Exercise 3-6.</p>
<h3>Exercise 3-6: Write Your First Shell Script</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, a shell script is a text file that contains a list
of shell commands. When you tell your shell to run the script, it runs
those commands one at a time. Many commands are themselves shell
scripts, such as the <code>man</code>
command you used earlier in this chapter.</p>
<h4>Navigate to Your USB Disk</h4>
<p>Make sure your <em>datasets</em> USB disk is plugged in and mounted, and open
up a terminal. To change your working directory to the <em>datasets</em> disk,
skip to the subsection for your operating system.</p>
<h5>Windows</h5>
<p>After mounting your USB disk, open File Explorer by clicking <strong>This PC</strong>
on the left. This page will show all of your connected drives and their
drive letters. Note your USB disk&rsquo;s drive letter, then change your
working directory to the disk by running the following command,
substituting <code>d</code> for
the correct drive letter:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>/mnt/d/
</code></pre></div>

<p>Your shell&rsquo;s working directory should now be your <em>datasets</em> USB disk.
To check, run <code>ls</code> to view the
files on this disk.</p>
<h5>macOS</h5>
<p>After mounting your <em>datasets</em> USB disk, open a terminal and change your
working directory to the disk by running the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>/Volumes/datasets
</code></pre></div>

<p>Your shell&rsquo;s working directory should now be your <em>datasets</em> USB disk.
To check, run <code>ls</code> to view the
files on this disk.</p>
<h5>Linux</h5>
<p>After mounting your <em>datasets</em> USB disk, open a terminal and change your
working directory to the disk. In Linux, the path to your disk is
probably something like
<em>/media/&lt;username&gt;/datasets</em>.
For example, my username is <em>micah</em>, so I would run this command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>/media/micah/datasets
</code></pre></div>

<p>Your shell&rsquo;s working directory should now be
your <em>datasets</em> USB disk. To check, run <code>ls</code> to view the files on this disk.</p>
<h4>Create an Exercises Folder</h4>
<p>The <code>mkdir</code> command creates a
new folder. Now that you&rsquo;re in your USB disk drive in your terminal, run
the following commands to create a new folder called <em>exercises</em>, and
then switch to it:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>mkdir<span class="w"> </span>exercises
<span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>exercises
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now make a folder for your Chapter 3
exercises:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>mkdir<span class="w"> </span>chapter-3
</code></pre></div>

<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll open the <em>exercises</em> folder in VS Code.</p>
<h4>Open a VS Code Workspace</h4>
<p>Each VS Code window is called a <em>workspace</em>. You can add folders to your
workspace, which allows you to easily open any files in that folder or
create new ones. To open a VS Code workspace for your <em>exercises</em>
folder, run the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>code<span class="w"> </span>.
</code></pre></div>

<p>If the argument that you pass into <code>code</code> is a folder, like <code>.</code> (the current working directory), VS
Code will add that folder to your workspace. If the path is a file, like
in Exercise 3-5 when you opened <em>/tmp/example.html</em>, it will open just
that file.</p>
<p>Next, create a new file in the <em>chapter-3</em> folder. To do this,
right-click the <em>chapter-3</em> folder, choose <strong>New File</strong>, name your file
<em>exercise-3-6.sh</em>, and press <strong>ENTER</strong>. This should create a new
file that you can edit. Since the file extension is <em>.sh</em>, VS Code
should correctly guess that it&rsquo;s a shell script and use the right type
of syntax highlighting.</p>
<p>Figure 3-7 shows a VS Code workspace with the
<em>exercises</em> folder added and the empty file <em>exercise-3-6.sh</em> created.</p>
<p>The VS Code window is split into two main parts. The Explorer panel on
the left shows the contents of all of the folders added to your
workspace. In this case, it shows <em>exercises</em> and everything it
contains: a <em>chapter-3</em> folder and the <em>exercise-3-6.sh</em> file you just
created. The right side of the window is the editor, where you&rsquo;ll enter
your shell script.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 3-7: VS Code with the exercises folder open in a workspace" src="media/images/Figure3-7.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 3-7: VS Code with the exercises folder open in a workspace</em></p>
<h4>Write the Shell Script</h4>
<p>Enter the following text into <em>exercise-3-6.sh</em> in VS Code and save the
file:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="ch">#!/bin/bash</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello world! This is my first shell script.&quot;</span>
<span class="c1"># Display the current user</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;The current user is:&quot;</span>
whoami
<span class="c1"># Display the current working directory</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;The current working directory is:&quot;</span>
<span class="nb">pwd</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The first line that starts with <code>#!</code> is called the <em>shebang</em>, and it tells
the shell which <em>interpreter</em>&mdash;the program that opens and runs the
script&mdash;to use. In this case, the shell will use <code>/bin/bash</code>, meaning you&rsquo;re writing a bash script.
In this book, you&rsquo;ll add that same shebang to the top of all of your
shell scripts. Even if you&rsquo;re working from a shell besides bash, this
shebang tells your computer to run the current script using bash.</p>
<p>In shell scripts, lines that start with the hash character (<code>#</code>) are called <em>comments</em>, and they don&rsquo;t
affect how the code itself works; if you removed the comments from this
script, it would run the same way. The first character of the shebang is
a hash character, which means that it&rsquo;s technically a comment in bash
and zsh.</p>
<p>Comments like <code># Display the current user</code> work as notes to remind you what your
code does when you come back to a script you wrote months or years
earlier. Anyone else who works with your code, perhaps trying to fix
something or add features, will appreciate your comments for the same
reason.</p>
<p>The <code>echo</code> command displays text to the terminal.
The <code>whoami</code> command displays
the name of the user running the script. The <code>pwd</code> command displays the current working
directory.</p>
<h4>Run the Shell Script</h4>
<p>Before you can run a script, you need to make it <em>executable</em> by giving
it permission to run as a program. The <code>chmod</code> command lets you change permissions on
files with the following syntax:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>chmod permissions filename
</code></pre></div>

<p>To mark a file as executable, use <code>+x</code> as the <code>permissions</code> argument. Run the following
command in your terminal (from within your <em>exercises</em> folder):</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>chmod<span class="w"> </span>+x<span class="w"> </span>./chapter-3/exercise-3-6.sh
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can now run the script by entering either its absolute path or its
relative path:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>./chapter-3/exercise-3-6.sh
</code></pre></div>

<p>Starting your command with <code>./</code> tells your shell that you&rsquo;re entering
the relative path to a script.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the output I get when I run this script on my Mac:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Hello world! This is my first shell script.
The current user is:
micah
The current working directory is:
/Volumes/datasets/exercises
</code></pre></div>

<p>The current user is <em>micah</em> and the current working directory is
<em>/Volumes/datasets/exercises</em>.</p>
<p>This script shows you different output depending on your working
directory. To demonstrate the differences, here&rsquo;s what happens when I
switch to my home folder and then run it again:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>micah@trapdoor exercises % cd ~
micah@trapdoor ~ % /Volumes/datasets/exercises/chapter-3/exercise-3-6.sh
Hello world! This is my first shell script.
The current user is:
micah
The current working directory is:
/Users/micah
</code></pre></div>

<p>This time, the current working directory in the output has changed to
<em>/Users/micah</em>. Try switching to your own home folder with
<code>cd ~</code> and running the script
again.</p>
<p>The script also shows different output depending
on which user is running it. So far I&rsquo;ve been running it as <em>micah</em>, but
here&rsquo;s what the output looks like when I run it as root:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>micah@trapdoor ~ % sudo /Volumes/datasets/exercises/chapter-3/exercise-3-6.sh
Password:
Hello world! This is my first shell script.
The current user is:
root
The current working directory is:
/Users/micah
</code></pre></div>

<p>This time, the output lists the current user as <code>root</code>. Try running the script as root on
your own computer.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll write many more scripts throughout this book. I&rsquo;ve included a
copy of the code for every exercise in this book&rsquo;s online resources. In
Exercise 3-7, you&rsquo;ll download a copy of all of this code.</p>
<h3>Exercise 3-7: Clone the Book’s GitHub Repository</h3>
<p>Programmers store source code in <em>git repositories</em> (or <em>git repos</em> for
short), which are composed of a collection of files (usually source
code) and the history of how they have changed over time. By storing
your scripts this way, you can host them on GitHub, a popular website
for hosting git repos. Git repos help you share your code with others,
and they make it easier for multiple people to write code for the same
project. When you <em>clone</em> a git repo, you download a copy of it to your
computer.</p>
<p>This book comes with a git repo at
<a href="https://github.com/micahflee/hacks-leaks-and-revelations">https://github.com/micahflee/hacks-leaks-and-revelations</a>
containing the code for every exercise and case study in this book,
along with additional instructions and source code related to the book&rsquo;s
appendixes. In this exercise, you&rsquo;ll clone this repo and store the copy
locally on your computer.</p>
<p>First, check whether the <code>git</code>
program is installed on your machine:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>which<span class="w"> </span>git
</code></pre></div>

<p>If git is installed, you&rsquo;ll see its path in the output, like
<em>/usr/bin/git</em>. If it&rsquo;s not installed, this command won&rsquo;t display
anything in the terminal. In that case, install git by entering the
appropriate command for your operating system:
<code>brew install git</code> for macOS
users, or <code>sudo apt install git</code> for Linux and WSL users.</p>
<p>Next, in your terminal, change to your USB disk folder. On my macOS
computer, I do this with the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>/Volumes/datasets
</code></pre></div>

<p>If necessary, replace the path in my command with the appropriate path
to your <em>datasets</em> USB disk for your operating system.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re in the <em>datasets</em> disk, run this
command to clone the repo:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>git<span class="w"> </span>clone<span class="w"> </span>https://github.com/micahflee/hacks-leaks-and-revelations.git
</code></pre></div>

<p>This should create a new folder called <em>hacks-leaks-and-revelations</em>
containing all of the code from the book&rsquo;s repo.</p>
<p>Finally, add the book&rsquo;s git repo folder to your VS Code workspace. In VS
Code, click <strong>File</strong> ▸ <strong>Add Folder to Workspace</strong>, then
browse for the <em>hacks-leaks-and-revelations</em> folder on your USB disk.
This will add the book&rsquo;s code to your VS Code workspace so you can
easily browse through all of the files.</p>
<p>You now have access to solutions for all future exercises! In the
following chapters, I&rsquo;ll walk you through the process of writing your
own scripts from scratch, but you can also run the complete scripts
taken from the git repo or copy and paste their code into your own code.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In this chapter, you&rsquo;ve learned the basics of command line theory,
including how to use the shell in a terminal, run various shell
commands, and navigate the shell using features like tab completion. You
installed software directly in the terminal using a package manager, and
you wrote your first simple shell script.</p>
<p>In the next chapters, you&rsquo;ll put these techniques into practice to
explore hundreds of gigabytes of data, make datasets searchable, convert
email from a proprietary format to an open format, and write Python
code. You&rsquo;ll start in the following chapter by taking a deeper dive into
the BlueLeaks dataset.</p>
