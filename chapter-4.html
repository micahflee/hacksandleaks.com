          <h1>Chapter 4: Exploring Datasets in the Terminal</h1>
          <p>In this chapter, you&rsquo;ll build on the command line skills you&rsquo;ve learned
so far and begin investigating real datasets. You&rsquo;ll use <code>for</code> loops to unzip the BlueLeaks files,
then search the files to determine which fusion centers have the most
data and which documents contain the keywords <em>antifa</em> and <em>Black Lives
Matter</em>. I&rsquo;ll also give an overview of the mysterious encrypted data in
the dataset and describe my hypothesis of how the hacker collected the
data.</p>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section id="content" data-content="chapter-4">
        <div class="wrapper" id="about-content"><p>You&rsquo;ll also learn to create Linux cloud servers and connect to them
securely for faster internet and extra disk space. As practice, you&rsquo;ll
use a remote server to download and briefly examine hacked data from the
Oath Keepers militia, a far-right extremist group that participated in
the January 6, 2021, US Capitol insurrection.</p>
<h3>Introducing for Loops</h3>
<p>The BlueLeaks torrent you downloaded in Exercise 2-1 is 269GB and
contains 168 different ZIP files ranging from 49GB to half a kilobyte
each. In theory, you could manually unzip these 168 files one at a time
to access the data. However, this slow, tedious process becomes
impractical with even larger datasets (imagine individually extracting
10,000 ZIP files). In this section, you&rsquo;ll learn to speed up this task
by automating it with <code>for</code>
loops.</p>
<p>A <code>for</code> loop is a type of
command that runs a piece of code once for every item in a list. Each
time the code loops, it stores the current item in a <em>variable</em>, which
you can think of as a placeholder for some value. Code variables are
similar to those in math, where the value of <em>x</em> might be different for
different problems, but in shell scripting, the values can be text or
numbers. Even though each loop runs the same code, the results may be
different, because the value of the variable changes with each loop.</p>
<p>For example, the following <code>for</code> loop displays the numbers 1, 2, and 3:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">for</span><span class="w"> </span>NUMBER<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="m">1</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="m">2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="m">3</span>
<span class="k">do</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nb">echo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">$NUMBER</span>
<span class="k">done</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This <code>for</code> loop starts with the syntax <code>for variable_name in list_of_items</code>, followed by <code>do</code>, followed by the commands to run for
each item in the list, followed by <code>done</code>. In this case, <code>variable_name</code> is <code>NUMBER</code> and <code>list_of_items</code> is <code>1 2 3</code>. The value of the <code>NUMBER</code> variable will be <code>1</code> the first time the code loops,
<code>2</code> during the second loop,
and <code>3</code> during the third loop.</p>
<p>The <code>echo</code> command displays
something, in this case <code>$NUMBER</code>, to the terminal. The dollar sign
(<code>$</code>) means the code should
display the value of the <code>NUMBER</code> variable, rather than the word
<code>NUMBER</code>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>Using all caps is a common convention for variable names, but it&rsquo;s not
required. For example, you could call the variable <code>number</code> instead of <code>NUMBER</code> and display it with
<code>echo $number</code> instead of <code>echo $NUMBER</code>.
Variable names are case sensitive.</em></p>
<p>When you run the previous <code>for</code> loop in your terminal, you should see
the following output:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>1
2
3
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can also use a <code>for</code> loop
to loop through the output of another shell command, as shown in the
following code:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">for</span><span class="w"> </span>FILENAME<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">$(</span>ls<span class="w"> </span>*.zip<span class="k">)</span>
<span class="k">do</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nb">echo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;ZIP filename: </span><span class="nv">$FILENAME</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
<span class="k">done</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The variable name in this code is
<code>FILENAME</code>. Next,
<code>$(ls *.zip)</code> tells your
machine to run the <code>ls *.zip</code>
command. This command outputs a list of all of the ZIP files in the
current folder, producing a list of filenames. The <code>for</code> loop cycles through that list and runs
the code between <code>do</code> and <code>done</code> for each filename. In
this case, the <code>echo</code> command prints the filenames to the terminal in <code>ZIP filename: filename</code> format.</p>
<p>For example, here&rsquo;s what it looks like when I run this code in the
<em>BlueLeaks</em> folder in my terminal on macOS:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>micah@trapdoor BlueLeaks % for FILENAME in $(ls *.zip)
for&gt; do
for&gt;     echo &quot;ZIP filename: $FILENAME&quot;
for&gt; done
ZIP filename: 211sfbay.zip
ZIP filename: Securitypartnership.zip
ZIP filename: acprlea.zip
--snip--
</code></pre></div>

<p>Each time the code loops, the value of <code>FILENAME</code> is the name of one of the ZIP files.
When the <code>echo</code> command runs,
it displays those filenames, one after another.</p>
<h3>Exercise 4-1: Unzip the BlueLeaks Dataset</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you&rsquo;ll write a script to unzip all the ZIP files in
BlueLeaks so you can work with the data they contain. Once unzipped, the
files will take 271GB of additional space on your <em>datasets</em> USB.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using macOS or Linux, follow the instructions in Unzip Files
on macOS or Linux next. If you&rsquo;re using Windows, read that
subsection to learn how to write <code>for</code> loops in bash since you&rsquo;ll need that
skill later in the book, but you won&rsquo;t need to follow along until
Unzip Files on Windows on page 92.</p>
<h4>Unzip Files on macOS or Linux</h4>
<p>Open a terminal and navigate to your <em>BlueLeaks</em> folder by running the
following command, replacing <code>blueleaks_path</code> with your own folder path:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>blueleaks_path
</code></pre></div>

<p>On Linux, I&rsquo;d use this command (your path will be different):</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>/media/micah/datasets/BlueLeaks
</code></pre></div>

<p>On macOS, I&rsquo;d use the following (again, your path will vary):</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>/Volumes/datasets/BlueLeaks
</code></pre></div>

<p>Run <code>ls</code> to see the list of files in this folder
and <code>ls -lh</code> to see detailed
information about these files, like their sizes.</p>
<p>To unzip single files, you use the following syntax:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>unzip<span class="w"> </span>filename
</code></pre></div>

<p>For example, run this command to unzip the first file in BlueLeaks:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>unzip<span class="w"> </span>211sfbay.zip
</code></pre></div>

<p>This should extract the 2.6GB <em>211sfbay.zip</em> file into the folder called
<em>211sfbay</em>. Run <code>ls</code> again and
you should see the new folder containing all of the hacked data from one
of the BlueLeaks sites.</p>
<p>However, you want to unzip <em>all</em> of the BlueLeaks files. Delete the
<em>211sfbay</em> folder:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>rm<span class="w"> </span>-r<span class="w"> </span>211sfbay
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>rm</code> command on its own
deletes files; to delete entire folders, you include <code>-r</code> (short for <code>--recursive</code>). The <code>-r</code> option deletes all the files in that
folder, and all the files in folders in that folder, and so on, before
finally deleting the target folder.</p>
<p>Navigate to your text editor, create a new folder in your <em>exercises</em>
folder called <em>chapter-4</em>, and create a new file in the <em>chapter-4</em>
folder called <em>exercise -4-1-unzip.sh</em>. (Storing your script in a
separate folder prevents you from polluting the dataset with your own
files.) In your new file, enter the following code:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="ch">#!/bin/bash</span>
<span class="k">for</span><span class="w"> </span>FILENAME<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">$(</span>ls<span class="w"> </span>*.zip<span class="k">)</span>
<span class="k">do</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nb">echo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;Unzipping </span><span class="nv">$FILENAME</span><span class="s2">...&quot;</span>
<span class="w">    </span>unzip<span class="w"> </span>-o<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">$FILENAME</span>
<span class="k">done</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Since <em>exercise-4-1-unzip.sh</em> is a shell script, it begins with the same
<code>#!/bin/bash</code> shebang as the
script in Chapter 3. After you define this
<code>for</code> loop, the script starts
it with <code>do</code> and ends it with
<code>done</code>, running the
<code>echo "Unzipping $FILENAME…"</code>
and <code>unzip -o $FILENAME</code>
commands over and over. The <code>echo</code> command displays the value of the
<code>FILENAME</code> variable, which
changes to a new filename with each loop, and the <code>unzip</code> command unzips that file. The
<code>-o</code> argument tells
<code>unzip</code> to <em>overwrite</em> files
if necessary, meaning that if any file being unzipped already exists,
the script will replace it with the newer version.</p>
<p>For example, when you run this code on BlueLeaks, the value of
<code>FILENAME</code> during the first
loop is <code>211sfbay.zip</code>. The
code that runs in this loop is equivalent to the following commands:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">echo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;Unzipping 211sfbay.zip...&quot;</span>
unzip<span class="w"> </span>-o<span class="w"> </span>211sfbay.zip
</code></pre></div>

<p>The second time the code loops, it runs the same
code with <code>acprlea.zip</code> as the
<code>FILENAME</code> value, and so on.</p>
<p>Change to your <em>BlueLeaks</em> folder. On my Mac, I do this by running the
following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>/Volumes/datasets/BlueLeaks
</code></pre></div>

<p>Next, make this shell script executable and run it as follows:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>chmod<span class="w"> </span>+x<span class="w"> </span>../exercises/chapter-4/exercise-4-1-unzip.sh
../exercises/chapter-4/exercise-4-1-unzip.sh
</code></pre></div>

<p>These commands assume that your <em>exercises</em> folder is in the same folder
as the <em>BlueLeaks</em> folder. The relative path to your <em>exercises</em> folder
is <em>../exercises</em>, and the relative path to the shell script you just
saved is <em>../exercises/chapter-4/exercise-4-1-unzip.sh</em>.</p>
<p>After you run these commands, your script should begin unzipping all 168
BlueLeaks files. Sit back, relax, and perhaps enjoy a beverage while you
wait for it to finish, which could take hours.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5>LOOPING THROUGH FILENAMES WITH SPACES</h5>
<p>Looping over the output of <code>ls</code> as you’ve just done works only if the filenames don’t contain spaces. If they did, your script would fail due to invalid filenames. For example, if you had a file called <code>Work Documents.zip</code> in the folder, the <code>for</code> loop would consider it two files, <code>Work</code> and <code>Documents.zip</code>, as discussed in Chapter 3.</p>
<p>The output of the <code>ls</code> command is a string—that is, a list of characters—with each filename separated by a newline character (<code>\n</code>), which represents a line break. If you have two files in a folder, <code>readme.txt</code> and <code>Work Documents.zip</code>, the <code>ls</code>
command outputs a string like <code>readme.txt\nWork Documents.zip</code>.</p>
<p>The bash shell includes an environment variable called <code>IFS (short for “internal field separator”)</code>, which the shell uses to figure out how to split strings in a <code>for</code> loop. By default, strings are split by any whitespace: spaces, tabs, or newlines. This is why, if you loop through the string <code>1 2 3</code>, you get three smaller strings—<code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>—separated with spaces. Likewise, looping through the string <code>readme.txt\nWork Documents.zip</code> results in the smaller strings <code>readme.txt</code>,<code>Work</code>, and <code>Documents.zip</code>, separated with a newline character and a space.</p>
<p>To work with filenames with spaces, you change the value of the <code>IFS</code> variable so that it splits strings only on newline characters, but not on spaces or tabs. Then you change it back after the loop. Here’s an example:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="ch">#!/bin/bash</span>
<span class="nv">ORIGINAL_IFS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$IFS</span>
<span class="nv">IFS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span><span class="nb">echo</span><span class="w"> </span>-n<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;\n&quot;</span><span class="k">)</span>
<span class="k">for</span><span class="w"> </span>FILENAME<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">$(</span>ls<span class="k">)</span>
<span class="k">do</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nb">echo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$FILENAME</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
<span class="k">done</span>
<span class="nv">IFS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$ORIGINAL_IFS</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Inside the <code>for</code> loop, the <code>FILENAME</code> variable will contain the full filename, even if it includes spaces. You can use code like this to unzip files (as long as they’re all ZIP files) or open them using any other CLI program.</p>
<p>None of the ZIP filenames in the BlueLeaks data have spaces, but you may need to use this script on filenames with spaces for future projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not using Windows, skip ahead to the Organize Your Files section on page 93. Otherwise, read on.</p>
<h4>Unzip Files on Windows</h4>
<p>Unzipping files in WSL from a USB disk formatted for Windows might be
<em>very</em> slow, due to WSL performance problems. Fortunately, there&rsquo;s a
much faster way to unzip all 168 files in BlueLeaks, using PowerShell
and a program called 7-Zip.</p>
<h5>Install 7-Zip</h5>
<p>The open source Windows archiving program 7-Zip lets you extract various
types of compressed files<em>.</em> Download and install 7-Zip from
<a href="https://www.7-zip.org">https://www.7-zip.org</a>.
You&rsquo;ll receive a warning saying that the program is made by an unknown
publisher, but it&rsquo;s safe to install as long as you&rsquo;ve downloaded it from
the official website.</p>
<p>After you install 7-Zip, you can use its <em>7z.exe</em> program to extract
files directly from PowerShell. By default, <em>7z.exe</em> should be located
in <em>C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe</em>. However, to run the program from
any directory, add <em>C:\Program Files\7-Zip</em> to your <code>Path</code> environment variable.</p>
<p><em>Environment variables</em> are variables that already exist when you open
your shell, as opposed to ones that you create in a <code>for</code> loop or by other methods. The
<code>Path</code> environment variable is
a list of folders that contain programs. It contains some folders by
default, but you can also add your own. When you run <code>7z</code>, PowerShell looks in each folder
listed in <code>Path</code> and checks
for a file called <em>7z.exe</em>, then runs that program for you.</p>
<p>To add <em>7z.exe</em> to <code>Path</code>,
click <strong>Start</strong>, search for <strong>environment variables</strong>, and click <strong>Edit
the System Environment Variables</strong>. In the window that opens, click
<strong>Environment Variables</strong>, and you should see a window with lists of
user variables and system variables. Double-click <strong>Path</strong> in the User
Variables box, which should show you all of the folders stored in
<code>Path</code>. Click <strong>New</strong>, add
<em>C:\Program Files\7-Zip</em>, and click <strong>OK</strong> to save. If you have a
PowerShell window open, close PowerShell and open
it again, forcing the shell to use the new changes to the <code>Path</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>You can now use the <code>7z</code>
command to run 7-Zip.</p>
<h5>Unzip in PowerShell with 7-Zip</h5>
<p>In a PowerShell terminal, change to the <em>BlueLeaks</em> folder on your
<em>datasets</em> USB disk. For example, on my computer, I run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">cd </span><span class="n">D</span><span class="p">:\</span><span class="n">BlueLeaks</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Next, run the following PowerShell commands (this is the PowerShell
version of the <em>exercise-4-1-unzip.sh</em> shell script in the previous
subsection):</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nv">$ZipFiles</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="nb">Get-ChildItem</span> <span class="n">-Path</span> <span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">-Filter</span> <span class="s2">&quot;*.zip&quot;</span>
<span class="k">foreach</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$ZipFile</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="nv">$ZipFiles</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">7z</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="nv">$ZipFile</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">FullName</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The first line sets the PowerShell variable <code>$ZipFiles</code> to the list of ZIP files it finds in
the current folder, represented by the dot (<code>.</code>). This is followed by a
<code>foreach</code> loop, which loops
through this list, setting the variable <code>$ZipFile</code> to the name of each file. The
<code>7z</code> command runs over and
over again for each different filename, unzipping each file.</p>
<p>When I run these commands in my PowerShell terminal, I get the following
output:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Scanning the drive for archives:
1 file, 2579740749 bytes (2461 MiB)

Extracting archive: D:\BlueLeaks\211sfbay.zip
--
Path = D:\BlueLeaks\211sfbay.zip
Type = zip
Physical Size = 2579740749
--snip--
</code></pre></div>

<p>Your PowerShell window should likewise begin unzipping all 168 BlueLeaks
files.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>Once you&rsquo;re finished with this chapter, read Appendix
A and implement one of the solutions it describes for
avoiding WSL performance problems to make it easier to work with big
datasets like BlueLeaks in Windows going forward. You&rsquo;ll use WSL for the
remainder of the book, so you&rsquo;ll need a plan to resolve any issues you
encounter.</em></p>
<h4>Organize Your Files</h4>
<p>Your <em>BlueLeaks</em> folder should now be full of both ZIP files and
extracted folders. Now you&rsquo;ll make a separate <em>BlueLeaks-extracted</em>
folder for the extracted data and keep the ZIP
files themselves in the <em>BlueLeaks</em> folder so that you can continue to
seed the torrent with them if you like.</p>
<p>Open a terminal (if you&rsquo;re in Windows, switch to a WSL Ubuntu terminal
again), change folders to your <em>datasets</em> USB disk, and run the
following commands:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>mv<span class="w"> </span>BlueLeaks<span class="w"> </span>BlueLeaks-extracted
mkdir<span class="w"> </span>BlueLeaks
mv<span class="w"> </span>BlueLeaks-extracted/*.zip<span class="w"> </span>BlueLeaks
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>mv</code> command moves or
renames files. On the first line, it renames the <em>BlueLeaks</em> folder
<em>BlueLeaks-extracted</em>. The <code>mkdir</code> command, which you used in Chapter
3, creates a new empty folder called
<em>BlueLeaks</em>. The third command moves all of the ZIP files in the
<em>BlueLeaks-extracted</em> folder into the newly created <em>BlueLeaks</em> folder.</p>
<p>Your <em>datasets</em> USB disk should now contain a folder called <em>BlueLeaks</em>
with 250GB of ZIP files, along with another folder called
<em>BlueLeaks-extracted</em> with 269GB of extracted hacked police data.</p>
<h3>How the Hacker Obtained the BlueLeaks Data</h3>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know how the hacker hacked and leaked the BlueLeaks files, but
we can make an educated guess based on clues from the dataset.</p>
<p>Imagine that it&rsquo;s June 6, 2020, less than two weeks after Minneapolis
cop Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for over
nine minutes while Floyd struggled to breathe, triggering the summer&rsquo;s
Black Lives Matter uprising against police violence. Millions of people
took to the streets to demand police accountability and the end of
racist police violence in what was &ldquo;the largest movement in the
country&rsquo;s history,&rdquo; according to the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>
<p>Now imagine you&rsquo;re a hacktivist. In addition to confronting police in
the streets, you&rsquo;re confronting them on the internet. Using OSINT,
you&rsquo;ve discovered that hundreds of police websites use the same shoddy
web application developed by the Texas web development firm Netsential.
All these sites run on Windows, use Microsoft&rsquo;s Internet Information
Services (IIS) web server software, and are programmed using Microsoft&rsquo;s
web framework ASP.NET. They&rsquo;re also all hosted from IP addresses in the
same data center in Texas.</p>
<p>After you spend some time poking around one of these sites, the Arizona
High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (AZHIDTA), you find what you were
looking for: a <em>remote code execution vulnerability</em>, a type of bug that
lets you run commands on a remote server, like the Windows server
running the AZHIDTA website. (My guess is that the vulnerability started
with SQL injection, a technology beyond the scope of this book.)</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong> <em>I&rsquo;m about to tell you about a potential URL for a hacking tool left
behind by the hacker, but don&rsquo;t actually try loading it in your browser
because it might be illegal. Attempting to access someone else&rsquo;s hacking
tools is definitely a legal gray area.</em></p>
<p>To open a shell on this web server, you use a
<em>web shell</em>, a web page that, when you submit a form with a command in
it, runs that command on the web server and responds with its output.
Using the vulnerability you discovered, you save a web shell into a file
called <em>blug.aspx</em> on the web server&rsquo;s disk. Loading <em>/blug.aspx</em> on the
<a href="https://www.azhidta.org">https://www.azhidta.org</a>
website in your browser allows you to run whatever commands you want on
the server.</p>
<p>The web shell <em>blug.aspx</em> is included in the BlueLeaks dataset. In order
to understand how this web shell works, I set up a Windows virtual
machine with an IIS server to test it, as shown in Figure
4-1. The left side of the screenshot is the
shell (in which I ran the command <code>dir c:\</code>). The right side let me browse the
server&rsquo;s filesystem and upload new files.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 4-1: Testing the blug.aspx web shell in a Windows VM" src="media/images/Figure4-1.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 4-1: Testing the blug.aspx web shell in a Windows VM</em></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know for sure if this is how the BlueLeaks hack happened, but I
think it&rsquo;s very likely. While researching BlueLeaks, I found the
following web shell files, all timestamped late on June 6, 2020, making
them among the most recently created files in the dataset:</p>
<p><strong><em>azhidta/ntdaddy.aspx</em></strong> The Classic ASP web shell NTDaddy, developed
around 2001 by a hacker named obzerve</p>
<p><strong><em>azhidta/blug.aspx</em></strong> The ASP.NET web shell called ASPX Shell,
developed in 2007 by a hacker named LT</p>
<p><strong><em>azhidta/pscp64.exe</em></strong> A program that comes with PuTTY, a popular
Windows tool for securely copying files to and from remote servers</p>
<p><strong><em>icefishx/7z.exe</em></strong> A copy of the 7-Zip compression and extraction
program</p>
<p>My guess is that the hacktivist first tried to create a <em>ntdaddy.aspx</em>
web shell, but found that it didn&rsquo;t work because it was developed using
an earlier version of ASP called Classic ASP, while the BlueLeaks site
used the modern version, ASP.NET. They then created the <em>blug.aspx</em> web
shell instead, used that shell to upload <em>pscp64.exe</em> and <em>7z.exe</em>, used
<em>7z.exe</em> to compress all of the files for a given police website, and
uploaded that data to their own server with <em>pscp64.exe</em>.</p>
<p>After manually hacking one of the BlueLeaks
sites, the hacker likely automated the process for the rest of the
BlueLeaks sites. Perhaps they created a shell script that used cURL
instead of a web browser to perform the same steps. They could have run
that script in a <code>for</code> loop
targeting all 251 websites, uploading hundreds of gigabytes of data to
themselves, in a single Saturday evening. They then likely forgot to
delete the <em>blug.aspx</em>, <em>pscp64.exe</em>, <em>7z.exe</em>, and <em>ntdaddy.aspx</em> files
before submitting the dataset to DDoSecrets.</p>
<h3>Exercise 4-2: Explore BlueLeaks on the Command Line</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you&rsquo;ll start exploring the contents of your unzipped
BlueLeaks files, using commands and advanced shell features that let you
quickly measure file and folder size and sort and count lines of output.</p>
<h4>Calculate How Much Disk Space Folders Use</h4>
<p>The <code>du</code> command (short for
&ldquo;disk usage&rdquo;) is a powerful tool for assessing a new dataset. Linux and
macOS come with slightly different versions of <code>du</code>. The Linux version, which is part of a
software package called GNU coreutils, is better and more up to date at
the time of writing, so you&rsquo;ll use it for this exercise.</p>
<p>Users of Linux and Windows with WSL should already have the correct
built-in <code>du</code> tool. If you&rsquo;re
using macOS, run <code>brew install coreutils</code> in the terminal to install coreutils.
After this, the <code>du</code> command
will run the macOS version of the tool, while the <code>gdu</code> command will run the coreutils version
that you just installed. In the following commands, macOS users should
replace <code>du</code> with
<code>gdu</code>.</p>
<p>To find out how much space the extracted BlueLeaks dataset takes, open
your terminal and run this command, using the path to the
<em>BlueLeaks-extracted</em> folder on your computer:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>du<span class="w"> </span>-sh<span class="w"> </span>--apparent-size<span class="w"> </span>/media/micah/datasets/BlueLeaks-extracted
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>-s</code> argument in this
command (short for <code>--summarize</code>) displays the total disk space of a
folder rather than how much space each file inside it takes up. The
<code>-h</code> argument (short for
<code>--human-readable</code>) shows file
sizes in units like kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes, rather than in
terms of system blocks (a unit that changes depending on how your disk
is set up). Finally, the <code>--apparent-size</code> argument shows you how big the files
actually are, as opposed to how much space they take up on your disk.</p>
<p>The command checks the size of every file in BlueLeaks and adds them
all together, so it takes a while to run. When it&rsquo;s done, it should tell
you that the <em>BlueLeaks-extracted</em> folder takes up 269GB.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>In addition to using <code>-h</code> to generate human-readable
units, you can specify which units you want to use. The <code>-b</code> argument, short for <code>--bytes</code>, shows file sizes in
bytes, <code>-k</code> shows them in kilobytes, and <code>-m</code> shows them in megabytes.</em></p>
<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll measure the size of an individual
folder in BlueLeaks. Change to your <em>BlueLeaks-extracted</em> folder; for
example, I&rsquo;d run <code>cd /media/micah/datasets/BlueLeaks-extracted</code> on my Linux computer. From there, run
the following command to measure the size of the <em>ncric</em> folder, which
contains documents from the Northern California Regional Intelligence
Center (NCRIC), the fusion center I&rsquo;ve spent the most time researching:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>du<span class="w"> </span>-sh<span class="w"> </span>--apparent-size<span class="w"> </span>ncric
</code></pre></div>

<p>The output should tell you that the <em>ncric</em> folder takes 19GB.</p>
<p>To find out the size of each folder in BlueLeaks, you could run the
<code>du -sh --apparent-size</code>
<code>path</code> command for
each folder, but it&rsquo;s quicker to use another <code>for</code> loop. Run the following code in the
terminal:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">for</span><span class="w"> </span>FOLDER<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">$(</span>ls<span class="k">)</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">do</span><span class="w"> </span>du<span class="w"> </span>-sh<span class="w"> </span>--apparent-size<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">$FOLDER</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">done</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>As shown here, you can run multiple commands on the same line by
separating them with semicolons (<code>;</code>). This one-liner loops through the
output of the <code>ls</code> command,
which, since you&rsquo;re currently in the <em>BlueLeaks-extracted</em> folder, is
the name of each BlueLeaks folder. The code stores these names in the
<code>FOLDER</code> variable and then,
inside each iteration of the loop, runs the
<code>du -sh --apparent-size $FOLDER</code> command.</p>
<p>Here are the first few lines of output:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>2.8G    211sfbay
29M     Securitypartnership
216M    acprlea
65M     acticaz
748M    akorca
--snip--
</code></pre></div>

<p>This shows you how much disk space each folder uses.</p>
<h4>Use Pipes and Sort Output</h4>
<p>You now know the size of each folder in the BlueLeaks dataset. Next,
you&rsquo;ll sort the 168 folders in order of disk space. By determining which
folders are the largest, you can quickly tell which fusion centers have
the most data and therefore are probably the biggest or most active.</p>
<p>To sort this list of folders by the smallest file size to the largest,
use the <code>sort</code> command, which
takes a list of text lines and, by default, sorts them
<em>alphanumerically</em>; that is, text is sorted alphabetically and numbers
are sorted by their first numeral. For example, the list <code>file1</code>, <code>file10</code>, <code>file2</code>, &hellip;, <code>file9</code> is sorted alphanumerically: since text
lines are sorted one character at a time, and since <code>1</code> is less than <code>2</code>, <code>file10</code> comes before <code>file2</code>.</p>
<p>To sort your BlueLeaks files by file size, modify the command with the
<code>-h</code>
(<code>--human-numeric-sort</code>)
argument. This argument pays attention to the <em>value</em> of numbers, not
just characters, so it correctly places smaller numerical values before
larger ones. It also takes file size units into account,
meaning it will place 2MB before 1GB, even
though 2 is numerically greater than 1.</p>
<p>In shell scripting, the <em>pipe</em> operator (<code>|</code>) lets you take the output of a command
to the left of the operator and pipe it into the command on the right.
When you pipe input into the <code>sort</code> command, it outputs a sorted version
of that input. Run the <code>for</code>
loop from the previous subsection, this time piping the output into
<code>sort</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">for</span><span class="w"> </span>FOLDER<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">$(</span>ls<span class="k">)</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">do</span><span class="w"> </span>du<span class="w"> </span>-sh<span class="w"> </span>-–apparent-size<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">$FOLDER</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">done</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>sort<span class="w"> </span>-h
</code></pre></div>

<p>This line first runs the <code>for</code>
loop that measures the space each BlueLeaks folder takes up. The output
of this code is a list of lines of text, where each line starts with the
human-readable size of a folder. Piping those lines of text as input
into the <code>sort -h</code> command
sorts those lines numerically while paying attention to the file size
units.</p>
<p>Your output should look like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>256     miacxold
256     ncric-history-good
256     ncricSteveBackup
259K    terrorismtip
548K    oaktac
625K    sccpca
--snip--
13G     lacleartraining
14G     jric
19G     ncric
36G     miacx
46G     repo
</code></pre></div>

<p>The folders that have the least data should be at the top: <em>miacxold</em>,
<em>ncric-history-good</em>, and <em>ncricSteveBackup</em> contain only empty
subfolders. The <em>repo</em> folder, the largest folder in BlueLeaks, should
appear at the bottom of the list, right after <em>miacx</em>, the
second-largest folder.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5>FILE SIZE UNITS AND CONVERSIONS</h5>
<p>You’re likely familiar with file size units like megabytes and gigabytes, and you might have a mental model of how much information those units can hold: Office documents are often a few megabytes, a two-hour video file might be a gigabyte or two, and a video game might be hundreds of gigabytes. Being able to convert between the different units of disk space is an important skill for working with large datasets.</p>
<p>Units like kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte, and terabyte sound metric, but they’re not. For instance, the <code>kilo-</code> prefix denotes a factor of 1,000, but there are 1,024 bytes in a kilobyte. Here’s a list of common conversions:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 byte (B): 8 bits, or 8 ones and zeros in binary</li>
<li>1 kilobyte (KB): 1,024 bytes</li>
<li>1 megabyte (MB): 1,024 kilobytes</li>
<li>1 gigabyte (GB): 1,024 megabytes</li>
<li>1 terabyte (TB): 1,024 gigabytes</li>
<li>1 petabyte (PB): 1,024 terabytes</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, the <code>ncric</code> folder in BlueLeaks is 20,008,051,852 bytes, which is 19,539,113.1KB, or 19,081.2MB, or 18.6GB—about 160 billion bits.`</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Create an Inventory of Filenames in a Dataset</h4>
<p>When you&rsquo;re working with an enormous dataset like BlueLeaks, it&rsquo;s
helpful to create an inventory of all of the files it contains by
listing them in a text file. This way you can easily count the number of
files in the dataset or search for filenames without having to go
through the much slower process of looping through the dataset itself.</p>
<p>You can create this inventory with the <code>find</code> command, which outputs a list of files
and folders in a folder. From within the <em>BlueLeaks-extracted</em> folder,
run the following command to list all of the files in BlueLeaks:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>find<span class="w"> </span>.<span class="w"> </span>-type<span class="w"> </span>f
</code></pre></div>

<p>The first argument after <code>find</code> is the folder whose contents you want
to list. This command uses a dot to find files in the current folder,
but you could use any relative or absolute path. The <code>-type f</code> arguments filters the list so it
includes only files. (To include only folders, add the <code>-type d</code> arguments.)</p>
<p>When you run this command, the names of the many files in BlueLeaks
should start rapidly scrolling across your terminal. To make the output
more manageable, run the command again, this time redirecting the output
into the file <em>../BlueLeaks-filenames.txt</em>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>find<span class="w"> </span>.<span class="w"> </span>-type<span class="w"> </span>f<span class="w"> </span>&gt;<span class="w"> </span>../BlueLeaks-filenames.txt
</code></pre></div>

<p>As discussed in Chapter 3, redirection tells
your shell to take the output from the left side of the redirection
operator (<code>&gt;</code>) and save it
into the file at the path you specify on the right. In this case, the
shell sends the list of filenames from the <code>find</code> command to the
<em>BlueLeaks-filenames.txt</em> file on your <em>datasets</em> USB disk, rather than
displaying the filenames across your terminal.</p>
<p>To read through these filenames at your leisure, open
<em>BlueLeaks-filenames.txt</em> in VS Code by running this command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>code<span class="w"> </span>../BlueLeaks-filenames.txt
</code></pre></div>

<p>It&rsquo;s easier to slowly scroll through these
files in your text editor, but there are too many to count with the
naked eye.</p>
<h4>Count the Files in a Dataset</h4>
<p>The <code>wc</code> command takes some
input and tells you how many characters, words, or lines it contains.
When used with the <code>-l</code> (or
<code>--lines</code>) argument, it counts
the number of lines. To count the lines in the <em>BlueLeaks-filenames.txt</em>
file you created, and by extension count the number of files in
BlueLeaks, run the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>cat<span class="w"> </span>../BlueLeaks-filenames.txt<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>wc<span class="w"> </span>-l
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>cat</code> command outputs the
contents of a file&mdash;in this case, <em>BlueLeaks-filenames.txt</em>. Instead of
displaying it, the command pipes the output into <code>wc</code> to count the number of lines that it
contains. It should tell you that there are just over <em>one million</em>
files in BlueLeaks.</p>
<p>Another way to get the same result is to run the <code>find</code> command from the previous section
again, and pipe its output into <code>wc</code>, like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>find<span class="w"> </span>.<span class="w"> </span>-type<span class="w"> </span>f<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>wc<span class="w"> </span>-l
</code></pre></div>

<p>That command takes longer to run, though, since it searches through the
whole dataset again (press <strong>CTRL</strong>-C to
cancel this command before it finishes).</p>
<h3>Exercise 4-3: Find Revelations in BlueLeaks with grep</h3>
<p>In the summer of 2020, while American society was going through a
long-due reckoning about the scale of racist police killings, right-wing
media (and police) instead focused on the dangers of the protesters
themselves. They lumped the modern civil rights movement into two
categories: &ldquo;Black Lives Matter&rdquo; and &ldquo;antifa,&rdquo; the latter a label used
by antifascist activists since the 1930s. The modern American antifa
movement grew in response to the 2016 election of Donald Trump and the
mainstreaming of white supremacy in the US.</p>
<p>The <code>grep</code> command will filter
input for keywords, letting you search the content of datasets for
newsworthy information. In this exercise, you&rsquo;ll use <code>grep</code> to find out what police had to say
about antifa during the protests.</p>
<h4>Filter for Documents Mentioning Antifa</h4>
<p>You&rsquo;ll start by grepping your list of filenames to find any that include
the word <em>antifa</em>. From the <em>BlueLeaks-extracted</em> folder, search the
<em>BlueLeaks-filenames.txt</em> file that you created in Exercise 4-2 by
running the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>cat<span class="w"> </span>../BlueLeaks-filenames.txt<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>grep<span class="w"> </span>antifa
</code></pre></div>

<p>This command pipes the output of
<code>cat ../BlueLeaks-filenames.txt</code>, which is a list of a million
filenames, into <code>grep antifa</code>.
This should filter the huge list of filenames to show you only those
that include the word <em>antifa</em>. However, it returns no results.</p>
<p>Since the <code>grep</code> command is
case sensitive, try again using the <code>-i</code> (or <code>--ignore-case</code>) argument:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>cat<span class="w"> </span>../BlueLeaks-filenames.txt<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>grep<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span>antifa
</code></pre></div>

<p>When I run this command, I get the following output:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>./ociac/files/EBAT1/U-FOUO_CFIX__OCIAC_JRA_DVE Use of Social Media_ANTIFA_ANTI-ANTIFA MOVEMENTS

./arictexas/files/DDF/ARIC-LES - Situational Awareness - Antifa Activity.pdf

</code></pre></div>

<p>This command returns 12 results, all files that have the term <em>antifa</em>
in their filenames. The <code>grep</code>
command might highlight your search terms in each line of output by
coloring them differently; I&rsquo;ve highlighted them here in bold. Open a
few of the documents in this list to see what they contain.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>You can run BlueLeaks documents through Dangerzone if you like, but the
risks are low with this dataset. These documents are now all public, so
if any have tracking technology that lets the original file owner know
someone is looking at the document, it doesn&rsquo;t matter much. Given that
these are hacked documents from police fusion centers, not attachments
on phishing email messages or something similar, they&rsquo;re also unlikely
to be malicious.</em></p>
<p>I often combine <code>find</code> and
<code>grep</code> to make lists of
filenames and filter those lists down, which allows me to locate files
on my computer more quickly and precisely than with my operating
system&rsquo;s graphical file search tools. For example, suppose you&rsquo;re
looking into the <em>azhidta</em> folder for the Arizona High Intensity Drug
Trafficking Area site. To quickly find any documents that have the word
<em>marijuana</em> in their filename, you could run
<code>find azhidta | grep -i marijuana</code>. To count the number of files with
<em>marijuana</em> in the filenames, you could pipe all of that into the
<code>wc -l</code> command.</p>
<h4>Filter for Certain Types of Files</h4>
<p>In addition to searching for keywords like <em>antifa</em> or <em>marijuana</em>,
<code>grep</code> can help you filter a
list of filenames to include only certain file types. Grep for Microsoft
Word documents, filenames that end in <em>.docx</em>, by running the following
command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>cat<span class="w"> </span>../BlueLeaks-filenames.txt<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>grep<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span>.docx
</code></pre></div>

<p>This command uses <code>cat</code> to
display the list of filenames in BlueLeaks, then filters it down for
those that contain <em>.docx</em>. You should see thousands of filenames scroll
by. To learn exactly how many, run the command again, this time piping
the output into <code>wc -l</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>cat<span class="w"> </span>../BlueLeaks-filenames.txt<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>grep<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span>.docx<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>wc<span class="w"> </span>-l
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>wc</code> command should tell
you that the previous command had 8,861 results.</p>
<h4>Use grep with Regular Expressions</h4>
<p>If you scroll through the <em>.docx</em> filenames you just found, you&rsquo;ll see
that a few of them aren&rsquo;t actually Word documents. For example, the
filename <em>./arictexas/files/DDF/2014 Austin City Limits Festival - APD
Threat Overview.docx.pdf</em> contains <em>.docx</em> but is actually a PDF.</p>
<p>When you use <code>grep</code>, you can
pass a regular expression (regex for short) into it as an argument. A
<em>regex</em> is a character or sequence of characters that defines a search
pattern. For example, the caret character (<code>^</code>) represents the beginning of a line,
and the dollar sign character (<code>$</code>) represents the end of a line.
Grepping for <code>something$</code> will
show you only results that end with <em>something</em>. Grepping for
<code>^something</code> will show you
only results that begin with <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>To search just for filenames that end with <em>.docx</em>, add a dollar sign
(<code>$</code>) to the end of the text
you&rsquo;re grepping for. For example, try running the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>cat<span class="w"> </span>../BlueLeaks-filenames.txt<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>grep<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span>.docx$<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>wc<span class="w"> </span>-l
</code></pre></div>

<p>The output should tell you that there are 8,737 results, 124 less than
the previous command. That means there are 8,737 Word docs in this
dataset.</p>
<p>Run the following command to find out how many Word docs are in the
<em>ncric</em> folder:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>cat<span class="w"> </span>../BlueLeaks-filenames.txt<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>grep<span class="w"> </span>^./ncric/<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>grep<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span>.docx$<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>wc<span class="w"> </span>-l
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>cat</code> command outputs the
list of filenames in BlueLeaks, which is then piped into the first
<code>grep</code> command, which in turn
filters your output down to files that begin with <em>./ncric</em>, using
<code>^</code>. Next, that output is
piped into the second <code>grep</code>
command, which further filters the output to files that end
with <em>.docx</em>, using <code>$</code>. Finally, the remaining output is
piped into the <code>wc -l</code>
command, which tells you how many lines are left. The output of the full
command should tell you that there are 600 Word docs in the <em>ncric</em>
folder.</p>
<p>On your own, try using <code>find</code>,
<code>grep</code>, and <code>wc</code> to find out how many PDFs (<em>.pdf</em>) and
Excel documents (<em>.xlsx</em>) are in the dataset. You can also experiment
with other file types.</p>
<h4>Search Files in Bulk with grep</h4>
<p>In addition to piping output from other commands into <code>grep</code>, you can use <code>grep</code> to search directly within text files
by using the following syntax:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>grep<span class="w"> </span>search_term<span class="w"> </span>filename
</code></pre></div>

<p>For example, Linux comes with a file called <em>/etc/passwd</em>, which
includes a list of users on the system. To find just the line about my
own user in that file, I can use one of the following commands:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>grep micah /etc/passwd
cat /etc/passwd | grep micah
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>grep</code> command opens the
<em>/etc/passwd</em> file and then searches it, while the <code>cat</code> command opens that file and then pipes
its contents into <code>grep</code>,
which searches it. Both of these commands output the following result:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>micah:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/micah:/bin/bash
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can use <code>grep</code> to search
multiple files, or even folders full of files, for hits all at once. As
noted earlier, to search a folder, you use the <code>-r</code> (or <code>--recursive</code>) argument and specify the name of a
folder. To specify multiple files at once, use an asterisk (<code>*</code>) as a wildcard character. For example,
you can use <code>*.txt</code> as the
filename to search all text files in your current folder.</p>
<p>There are CSV spreadsheets in every BlueLeaks folder that contain the
contents of the websites&rsquo; databases. Now that you&rsquo;ve grepped for
filenames that contain the keyword <em>antifa</em>, use the following command
to bulk-search the term <em>Black Lives Matter</em> in the contents of the
files, not just in their filenames:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>grep<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;black lives matter&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span>*/*.csv
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>-i</code> argument in this
command makes the search case insensitive. The
<code>black lives matter</code> argument
is the search term (in quotation marks, because it has spaces). The
<code>*/*.csv</code> argument is the path
to search, which uses two wildcard characters. These arguments tell
<code>grep</code> to open every folder,
then each file within those folders that ends in <em>.csv</em>, and search for
the <em>black lives matter</em> keyword.</p>
<p>This command takes some time to run because it&rsquo;s searching all 158,232
CSV files in BlueLeaks. When it&rsquo;s finished, it should show you the lines
from CSV files that mention <em>black lives matter</em> and tell you in which

<p>The command finds a total of 178 lines in BlueLeaks CSVs that contain
the term <em>black lives matter</em>. Each is a potential lead for further
investigative research.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>The <code>grep</code> command is a great tool for searching the content of text files, but it doesn&rsquo;t
work with binary files, like Microsoft Office documents or PDFs. To
search those in bulk, you&rsquo;ll need more sophisticated tools, which you&rsquo;ll
learn about in Chapter 5.</em></p>
<p>On your own, try using <code>grep</code>
to filter the list of BlueLeaks filenames for specific words or
bulk-search terms within the CSV files. If you find any interesting
documents, read them to see if they&rsquo;re newsworthy. Consider narrowing
your searches once you find a lead by looking for other related
documents. You might focus on a single fusion center or a topic like
antifa that spans different centers. Individual documents may contain
law enforcement lingo you can use as search terms for related documents.
Take detailed notes on what&rsquo;s most revealing in each document, then rely
on these notes if you decide to write about your findings.</p>
<h3>Encrypted Data in the BlueLeaks Dataset</h3>
<p>As you dig around in the BlueLeaks dataset, you&rsquo;ll notice some patterns.
Most folders contain many CSVs, as well as.<em>aspx</em> files, the source code
of the hacked websites. They also contain <em>files</em> subfolders containing
the bulk of the files and folders uploaded to each site,
including PDFs and Microsoft Office documents.</p>
<p>However, one folder, <em>repo</em>, contains just a <em>config</em> file and <em>data</em>,
<em>index</em>, <em>keys</em>, <em>locks</em>, and <em>snapshots</em> subfolders. Inside those
subfolders are other subfolders and files with apparently random names.
There are no documents that can be opened&mdash;no spreadsheets or similar
files. As you discovered in Exercise 4-2, the <em>repo</em> folder is the
largest folder in BlueLeaks, at 46GB. Its timestamps are from June 8,
2020, although the latest timestamps for most of the rest of the dataset
are from June 6. Without more information, it&rsquo;s not clear what these
files mean or how to access them.</p>
<p>When I discover a mystery like this in a dataset, I search the internet.
In this case, I searched for the names of the files and folders within
the <em>repo</em> folder by entering <em>config data index keys locks snapshots</em>
into a search engine, and found documentation for a CLI program called
restic. A restic repository, according to the documentation I found at
<a href="https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/100_references.html">https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/100_references.html</a>,
is a folder that holds backup data. Restic repositories contain a
<em>config</em> file and folders called <em>data</em>, <em>index</em>, <em>keys</em>, <em>locks</em>, and
<em>snapshots</em>, as shown in Figure 4-2.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 4-2: The layout of a restic respository" src="media/images/Figure4-2.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 4-2: The layout of a restic respository</em></p>
<p>This suggests that the <em>repo</em> folder in BlueLeaks contains backup data
in restic format. To find out what&rsquo;s inside this backup, I installed the
<code>restic</code> package. Users of
Linux or Windows with WSL can install <code>restic</code> using apt:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>restic
</code></pre></div>

<p>Mac users can install <code>restic</code> from Homebrew with the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>restic
</code></pre></div>

<p>I ran <code>restic --help</code> and
found that I could view the snapshots in a repository with the
<code>restic snapshots</code> command,
which I then used to try to view the snapshots in the <em>repo</em> folder like
so:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>restic<span class="w"> </span>snapshots<span class="w"> </span>--repo<span class="w"> </span>repo/
</code></pre></div>

<p>I was then confronted with a password prompt:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>enter password for repository:
</code></pre></div>

<p>This prompt indicates that the backup is encrypted. The only way to
proceed is to guess the password, which I haven&rsquo;t been able to do.</p>
<p>While a 46GB folder full of encrypted data in a public leak is rare,
it&rsquo;s not uncommon to stumble upon other encrypted files in datasets like
Office documents or ZIP files. I can&rsquo;t help but imagine that the most
interesting details in any dataset might be the encrypted parts.
Password-cracking is outside the scope of this book, but if you can
figure out the password for <em>repo</em>, please let me know.</p>
<h3>Data Analysis with Servers in the Cloud</h3>
<p>So far, you&rsquo;ve used the CLI <em>locally</em> on your own computer, but you can
also use it <em>remotely</em> via servers to which you connect through a cloud
network. DigitalOcean, AWS, Microsoft Azure, and countless other cloud
hosting companies rent virtual private servers (VPSes) to the public,
usually for a few dollars a month or a few cents an hour. All the
command line skills you&rsquo;ve learned so far apply to remote servers, too.</p>
<p>There are many advantages to working with massive datasets in the cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of dealing with USB hard disks, you can attach virtual hard
    disks to your virtual servers, increasing their size if you&rsquo;re
    running low on disk space.</li>
<li>VPS bandwidth is generally much better than residential or
    commercial internet service, speeding up large dataset downloads.</li>
<li>You can also pay for more powerful VPSes for scripts that require
    significant computational resources, so they no longer take hours or
    days to finish running.</li>
<li>Rather than being forced to wait while a script runs on your local
    machine, you can do whatever you want on your computer, even
    suspending it or shutting it down, while your remote server is
    crunching data.</li>
<li>If your source has the required technical skills, you can ask them
    to upload data to a VPS with a large hard disk, as discussed
    in Chapter 2. They can even do this anonymously using
    Tor. You can then download the dataset or choose to analyze it
    remotely on the VPS.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong> <em>Avoid working on cloud servers with high- or medium-sensitivity
datasets. The cloud hosting provider has total access over your VPS and
the data on it and can even give copies of that data to law enforcement
or other parties in response to legal requests.</em></p>
<p>This section will go into more detail on <em>SSH (Secure Shell)</em> software
(introduced in Chapter 2), which allows you
to securely get a shell on a VPS, as well as two tools that are
essential for working remotely on the command line: text-based window
managers and CLI text editors. This should prepare you to set up a VPS
in the next exercise.</p>
<p>The SSH protocol is a method for securely logging in to another computer
remotely. You can connect to a VPS remotely by running the <code>ssh</code> command with a username and the IP
address or domain name of the server to which you want to connect. For
example, to log in as the root user to the server with the hostname
<em>example.com</em>, you run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>ssh<span class="w"> </span>root@example.com
</code></pre></div>

<p>You then need to <em>authenticate</em> to the server, or prove that you have
permission to log in, by typing the user password or using <em>SSH keys</em>.
Similar to PGP keys (discussed in Chapter 2), generating an SSH key on your computer
gives you two files: a public key and a secret key. Once you put your
public key on the remote server, only people with your secret key on
their computer (hopefully just you) can remotely log in to that server
using SSH. If someone spies on your internet, they can&rsquo;t see anything
you&rsquo;re doing in your SSH session&mdash;they&rsquo;ll just see garbled encrypted
data. Every SSH key also has a <em>fingerprint</em>, a unique string of
characters that identifies that specific key. SSH keys are more secure
than passwords, so cloud providers often require that you use them. Once
you SSH into a remote server, you&rsquo;ll be dropped into a shell just like
the one on your own computer, but running on a computer across the
internet.</p>
<p>A <em>text-based window manager</em> is software that lets you open and switch
between separate shells in the same terminal window, all in the same SSH
session. Text-based window managers also allow you to keep programs
running in the background even if you disconnect from SSH, by
maintaining an active shell session on your VPS. This protects your work
if, for example, your laptop dies, you lose internet access, or you
close your terminal window by mistake.</p>
<p>For example, say you want to download BlueLeaks on your VPS and then
unzip it with a <code>for</code> loop. If
you close your terminal window before the loop is done, you&rsquo;ll quit the
remote shell, which will close the <code>unzip</code> program, and your remote work will
stop. However, if you SSH to your VPS, connect to a window manager
session, and then start unzipping BlueLeaks files, you can safely close
the terminal window without stopping your work. If you open a new
terminal later, SSH back into your server, and open your window manager
again, your previous session with all your running
programs should reappear. In the upcoming
exercise, you&rsquo;ll use the Byobu window manager, which comes with Ubuntu.</p>
<p>When you SSH into a remote server, you don&rsquo;t have easy access to a
graphical text editor like VS Code. To edit files&mdash;to modify a shell
script, for example&mdash;you&rsquo;ll need to use a CLI text editor instead. Two
popular CLI text editors are nano and vim. The nano text editor is
relatively easy to use but doesn&rsquo;t have advanced features, while vim is
more powerful but has a steeper learning curve. For simplicity&rsquo;s sake,
in the following exercise you&rsquo;ll use nano.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>Technically, you can use VS Code to edit files remotely over SSH, but
there are some limitations. See <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh">https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh</a> for more information on VS Code&rsquo;s support for editing files over SSH.</em></p>
<h3>Exercise 4-4: Set Up a VPS</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you&rsquo;ll create an account on a cloud hosting provider,
generate an SSH key, create a VPS on your cloud provider, SSH into it,
start a Byobu session, and install updates. To follow along you&rsquo;ll need
to spend a small amount of money. I provide detailed instructions for
using DigitalOcean in this exercise, but use whatever cloud hosting
provider you prefer, keeping in mind that the initial steps will likely
be slightly different.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com">https://www.digitalocean.com</a>
and create an account, providing a credit card number while signing up.
Use a strong password, store it in your password manager, and turn on
two-factor authentication.</p>
<h4>Generate an SSH Key</h4>
<p>To generate an SSH key, open a terminal on your local computer (if
you&rsquo;re using Windows, use a WSL terminal) and run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>ssh-keygen<span class="w"> </span>-t<span class="w"> </span>ed25519
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>ssh-keygen</code> command
generates an SSH key, while the options specify the type of encryption
key you want to generate&mdash;in this case, <code>ed25519</code>, which uses modern elliptic curve
encryption and is the most secure option.</p>
<p>After you run this command, the program will ask you a few questions,
starting with where you want to save your key. For example, I get the
following output on my Mac:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/micah/.ssh/id_ed25519):
</code></pre></div>

<p>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to use the default location for the key,
<em>\~/.ssh/id_ed25519</em>. Next, the program should ask you for a
passphrase:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
</code></pre></div>

<p>I recommend generating a random passphrase in your password manager,
saving it as <em>SSH key passphrase</em>, then copying and pasting the
passphrase into your terminal. After
pressing <strong>ENTER</strong>, re-enter your passphrase and press
<strong>ENTER</strong> again.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re done, the <code>ssh-keygen</code> command should have created two new
files: your SSH secret key in <em>\~/.ssh/id_ed25519</em> and your SSH public
key in <em>\~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</em>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>If you&rsquo;re using Windows and prefer to SSH from PowerShell, you can
install the OpenSSH client directly in Windows. Open a PowerShell window
as an administrator and run <code>Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0</code> to enable using the ssh
command from PowerShell.</em></p>
<h4>Add Your Public Key to the Cloud Provider</h4>
<p>Next, add your public key to your new DigitalOcean account. After
logging in to the web console, go to the Settings page and switch to the
Security tab. Click <strong>Add SSH Key</strong>, then copy and paste your SSH public
key into the form.</p>
<p>Back in your terminal, display the content of your public key by running
this command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>cat<span class="w"> </span>~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the output I get:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAILxYgUq1ePSRSv7LTITG5hecwNBQzs3EZmo4PRzsV4yT micah@trapdoor
.local
</code></pre></div>

<p>Your output should look similar, with the last word being your username
and the hostname of your own computer. Copy this whole string, starting
with <code>ssh-ed25519</code>, and paste
it into DigitalOcean, then give it a name, as shown in Figure
4-3.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 4-3: The form for adding a new SSH key to a DigitalOcean account" src="media/images/Figure4-3.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 4-3: The form for adding a new SSH key to a DigitalOcean account</em></p>
<p>Name your SSH keys after the computer on which
you generated them, since they&rsquo;re allowing this specific computer to
access remote computers. For example, I&rsquo;ve called my key <em>trapdoor</em>, the
name of my Mac.</p>
<h4>Create a VPS</h4>
<p>Now that DigitalOcean has your SSH public key, you can create a new VPS.
Click <strong>Create</strong> at the top of the DigitalOcean console and follow the
instructions to create a new <em>droplet</em>, DigitalOcean&rsquo;s term for a VPS.
Choose the following settings for your VPS:</p>
<ol>
<li>For Choose an Image, pick <strong>Ubuntu</strong>.</li>
<li>For Choose a Plan, pick <strong>Shared CPU</strong> ▸ <strong>Basic</strong> and
    choose how much memory, CPU power, hard disk space, and internet
    bandwidth you want. Less powerful machines are cheaper; more
    powerful ones are more expensive. For this exercise, choose a
    relatively cheap option like 1GB of RAM, 1 CPU, 25GB of disk space,
    and 1TB of bandwidth for $7 per month.</li>
<li>For Add Block Storage, you can choose to attach an additional hard
    disk to your droplet. You don&rsquo;t need to do this now, but in the
    future, to work with a large dataset like BlueLeaks, you can add
    more disk space.</li>
<li>For Choose a Datacenter Region, choose the host city for your VPS.
    File transfers between your computer and your server will be fastest
    if you choose a nearby location, but feel free to create your VPS
    anywhere you&rsquo;d like.</li>
<li>For Authentication, choose <strong>SSH Keys</strong> and select the SSH key that
    you just added to your DigitalOcean account.</li>
<li>For Select Additional Options, check the box beside Monitoring to
    see statistics about how much memory and processor power the VPS is
    using over time from the DigitalOcean console.</li>
<li>For Finalize and Create, choose one droplet and give it the hostname
    <em>test-vps</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Click <strong>Create Droplet</strong> and wait a minute or two for DigitalOcean to
provision your new VPS, then find its IP address. Figure
4-4 shows the Droplets page of my DigitalOcean
account with my new server&rsquo;s IP address, 178.128.22.151.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 4-4: My test-vps IP address" src="media/images/Figure4-4.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 4-4: My test-vps IP address</em></p>
<p>Click the IP address to copy it to your clipboard.</p>
<h4>SSH into Your Server</h4>
<p>Run the following command to SSH into your server:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>ssh<span class="w"> </span>username@hostname
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here, <code>username</code> is
the user you want to connect to on the remote server, and
<code>hostname</code> is either
the hostname or IP address of the remote server. With DigitalOcean, the
username is <code>root</code> and the
hostname is the IP address of your server.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what it looks like when I SSH into my server for the first time:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>micah@trapdoor ~ % ssh root@178.128.22.151
The authenticity of host &#39;178.128.22.151 (178.128.22.151)&#39; can&#39;t be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:062oSOXq+G1sGLIzoQdFnQvJE/BU8GLLWnNr5WUOmAs.
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
</code></pre></div>

<p>A remote server has its own SSH key, a <em>server key.</em> This output shows
you the server key&rsquo;s fingerprint and asks whether you want to trust it.
If you enter <code>yes</code>, your SSH
software will store this fingerprint in the <em>\~/.ssh/known_hosts</em> file
containing all the fingerprints for the SSH servers to which you&rsquo;ve
connected in the past, so that when you SSH into your server in the
future, it shouldn&rsquo;t prompt you again. You can also enter <code>no</code> to cancel, or copy and paste the
fingerprint of the server key that you&rsquo;re expecting.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>If you SSH into a server and the fingerprint isn&rsquo;t what your software
expects it to be, SSH will show you a warning message, which could mean
that the server key has changed or that your SSH connection is being
attacked. This authentication scheme is known as trust on first use
(TOFU): you trust the first fingerprint you see and deny
all other fingerprints for that server in the future.</em></p>
<p>Enter <code>yes</code> and press
<strong>ENTER</strong> to continue. You should be dropped into a root shell on
your remote server:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>root@test-vps:~#
</code></pre></div>

<p>Since you provided DigitalOcean with your SSH public key, you don&rsquo;t need
to enter a password to log in. If anyone else tries SSHing to your
server, they&rsquo;ll get the <code>Permission denied (publickey)</code> error.</p>
<p>Take a look around your new cloud-based system. Run <code>ls</code> to list files, <code>ls -al</code> to see hidden files, and <code>cd</code> to change to folders.</p>
<h4>Start a Byobu Session</h4>
<p>If you used the Ubuntu image to set up your droplet, the Byobu window
manager should be installed. Run the <code>byobu</code> command to start a Byobu session. (If
you&rsquo;re using a different operating system, or if for some reason Byobu
isn&rsquo;t installed, you&rsquo;ll get a <code>Command 'byobu' not found</code> error message. Run
<code>apt update</code>, followed by
<code>apt install byobu</code>, to install
the program.)</p>
<p>The <code>byobu</code> command should drop you into a shell
inside of your new session. A line at the bottom of your terminal shows
which window you&rsquo;ve opened, along with information like the date and
time. Each Byobu window is like its own separate shell in the same Byobu
session, and you can open as many windows as you want.</p>
<p>To demonstrate how Byobu works, run <code>whoami</code> (which should tell you that you&rsquo;re the
root user) and <code>ls -l /</code> (which
should show you a list of files in your server&rsquo;s root folder). Now press
<strong>CTRL</strong>-A. Byobu will ask you how you want this keyboard command
to operate:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Configure Byobu&#39;s ctrl-a behavior...

When you press ctrl-a in Byobu, do you want it to operate in:
    (1) Screen mode (GNU Screen&#39;s default escape sequence)
    (2) Emacs mode  (go to beginning of line)

Note that:
  - F12 also operates as an escape in Byobu
  - You can press F9 and choose your escape character
  - You can run &#39;byobu-ctrl-a&#39; at any time to change your selection

Select [1 or 2]:
</code></pre></div>

<p>Enter <code>1</code> and press
<strong>ENTER</strong>. This allows you to open a new window in Byobu by
pressing <strong>CTRL</strong>-A, followed by C (for &ldquo;create&rdquo;). Try that now to
open a new empty shell. Press <strong>CTRL</strong>-A followed by N (for
&ldquo;next&rdquo;) to switch back to your first window. To exit a Byobu window, you
run the <code>exit</code> command in that
shell.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>See <a href="https://www.byobu.org">https://www.byobu.org</a> for more complete documentation about this program, including a video tutorial.</em></p>
<p>Completely close your terminal window and click through any warnings
saying that your active programs will close if you do this. Open a new
terminal window and SSH back into your server using the <code>ssh username@hostname</code> command. Then run
<code>byobu</code> again to attach your
previous session. Any programs you run inside this Byobu session won&rsquo;t
quit when you disconnect from SSH.</p>
<h4>Install Updates</h4>
<p>Always install updates when you set up a new server to keep it secure.
Run the following commands (you don&rsquo;t need to use <code>sudo</code>, since you&rsquo;re the root user):</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>apt<span class="w"> </span>update
apt<span class="w"> </span>upgrade
</code></pre></div>

<p>Follow the instructions to finish installing updates.</p>
<p>If you ever need to reboot your server (such as after updating the Linux
kernel), run the <code>reboot</code>
command. You&rsquo;ll get kicked out of your SSH session,
but you should be able to SSH back in shortly when the reboot completes. You can also reboot your VPS from
DigitalOcean&rsquo;s web console&mdash;for example, if the entire server crashed
and you can&rsquo;t SSH into it.</p>
<h3>Exercise 4-5: Explore the Oath Keepers Dataset Remotely</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you&rsquo;ll use BitTorrent to download the Oath Keepers
dataset to your cloud server and explore it using the skills you&rsquo;ve
gained in this chapter. You&rsquo;ll also learn to copy data from your remote
server to your laptop using the <code>rsync</code> command. Finally, you&rsquo;ll delete your
VPS to avoid getting charged for time when you&rsquo;re not using it.</p>
<p>The Oath Keepers dataset contains data from the far-right extremist
group that participated in the January 6, 2021, US Capitol insurrection.
In September 2021, a hacktivist broke into the Oath Keepers servers and
made off with the group&rsquo;s email messages, chat logs, membership lists,
and other data, and then leaked it to DDoSecrets. You&rsquo;ll continue
working with this dataset when you learn to analyze email dumps in
Chapter 6.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>This book works only with the publicly available part of the Oath
Keepers dataset, which contains email messages and chat logs. To access
content like the Oath Keepers&rsquo; donor and membership lists, which contain
PII, contact DDoSecrets.</em></p>
<p>Because your home or office internet connection is likely significantly
slower than a cloud provider&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s inefficient to download a dataset
to your laptop and then upload it to your remote server. To download the
dataset directly to your VPS, you&rsquo;ll use <code>transmission-cli</code>, the command line version of the
BitTorrent client you used to download BlueLeaks in Chapter 2. In your VPS, run the following command to
install <code>transmission-cli</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>apt<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>transmission-cli
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can now use the <code>transmission-cli</code> command to download files. You must
pass in either the path to a <em>.torrent</em> file or a magnet link as an
argument. In this exercise, you&rsquo;ll use the torrent file available at
<a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Oath_Keepers">https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Oath_Keepers</a>.</p>
<p>Run the following commands:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>mkdir<span class="w"> </span>~/datasets
<span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>~/datasets
</code></pre></div>

<p>This creates a new folder called <em>datasets</em> on your server, then changes
to it. Download the torrent file from the link on the DDoSecrets page
and load it into your BitTorrent client with the following commands:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>wget<span class="w"> </span>https://ddosecrets.com/images/0/02/Oath_Keepers.torrent
transmission-cli<span class="w"> </span>-w<span class="w"> </span>.<span class="w"> </span>Oath_Keepers.torrent
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>wget</code> command downloads files&mdash;in this
case, <em>Oath_Keepers.torrent</em>&mdash;and saves them in the current folder.
The <code>transmission-cli</code> command
downloads the 3.9GB torrent to your server from the BitTorrent swarm and
uploads parts of it to other parts of the swarm. The <code>-w .</code> arguments tell
<code>transmission-cli</code> to download
the torrent into the current working folder. (You could change that to
<code>-w ~/Downloads</code>, for example,
if you wanted to download it into the <em>\~/Downloads</em> folder instead.)</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>If no torrent file is available for a dataset, you can replace the
torrent filename with a magnet link in double quotes as an argument in
the <code>transmission-cli</code> command.</em></p>
<p>When you&rsquo;ve finished downloading the torrent, your server will be a seed
until you quit the program by pressing <strong>CTRL</strong>-C. While you&rsquo;re
waiting for the dataset to finish downloading, or if you&rsquo;ve finished but
want to continue seeding the torrent, you can work on your VPS in a
separate Byobu shell.</p>
<p>To check how much free space your server has left, run the following
command after the download is complete:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>df<span class="w"> </span>-h
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>df</code> command tells you how
much disk space is free on each connected drive, and the <code>-h</code> argument displays these numbers in
human-readable units. After downloading the Oath Keepers dataset, I got
the following output from these commands on my server:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
tmpfs            98M 1000K   97M   2% /run
/dev/vda1        25G  5.8G   19G  24% /

tmpfs            98M  4.0K   98M   1% /run/user/0
</code></pre></div>

<p>As shown in bold, my root partition mounted on <code>/</code> has 25GB of space, has used 5.8GB, and
has 19GB free.</p>
<p>Change your working directory to <em>\~/datasets/Oath Keepers</em>, remembering
to put the filepath in quotes or escape the space in the path. For
example, you could run this command from the <em>\~/datasets</em> folder:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>Oath<span class="se">\ </span>Keepers
</code></pre></div>

<p>Run the following command to find that the Oath Keepers dataset takes up
3.9GB of space:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>root@test-vps:~/datasets/Oath Keepers# du -sh --apparent-size .
3.9G    .
</code></pre></div>

<p>Next, run the <code>ls</code> command to list the files in the <em>Oath
Keepers</em> folder:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>root@test-vps:~/datasets/Oath Keepers# ls -lh
total 13M
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Aug  2 23:47 &#39;Oath Keepers.sbd&#39;
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  12M Aug  2 23:47  messages.json
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1.4M Aug  2 23:44  messages_old.json
</code></pre></div>

<p>The output shows that this folder contains a folder called <em>Oath
Keepers.sbd</em>, a 12MB file called <em>messages.json</em>, and a 1.4MB file
called <em>messages_old.json</em>. These JSON files are chat logs.</p>
<p>Switch to the <em>Oath Keepers.sbd</em> folder and run <code>ls</code> again:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>root@test-vps:~/datasets/Oath Keepers# cd Oath\ Keepers.sbd/
root@test-vps:~/datasets/Oath Keepers/Oath Keepers.sbd# ls -lh
total 3.9G
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2.2M Aug  2 23:45  Archive
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  23K Aug  2 23:44 &#39;Saved Correspondence&#39;
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  25K Aug  2 23:44  Systems
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2.8M Aug  2 23:44  ak
--snip--
</code></pre></div>

<p>The output shows that this folder contains 100 files, each representing
a different inbox full of email.</p>
<p>Since you&rsquo;ll use the Oath Keepers dataset later in the book, next you&rsquo;ll
copy it from your VPS to your <em>datasets</em> USB disk with the
<code>rsync</code> program, which
synchronizes local folders and remote folders using SSH.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>The</em> <em><code>scp</code> command (short for &ldquo;secure copy&rdquo;) also copies files and folders from your computer to a remote server, or vice versa, over SSH. The BlueLeaks hacker likely used a Windows version of <code>scp</code>, pscp64.exe, to exfiltrate data from the hacked police web servers to a server they controlled. For very large folders, however, <code>rsync</code> is often a better choice than <code>scp</code>, since if it fails halfway through, you can rerun the command and it will start where it left off.</em></p>
<p>Open a terminal running locally on your computer (not SSHed to your VPS)
and run <code>which rsync</code> to check
whether <code>rsync</code> is installed.
If so, the command returns the path to the program, something like
<em>/usr/bin/rsync</em>. If not, you&rsquo;ll see no output. Windows with WSL and
Linux users can install <code>rsync</code> with the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>rsync
</code></pre></div>

<p>macOS users can install it with the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>rsync
</code></pre></div>

<p>To copy a file from a remote server to your
local computer, run the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>rsync<span class="w"> </span>-av<span class="w"> </span>--progress<span class="w"> </span>remote_user@remote_host:remote_path<span class="w"> </span>local_path
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>-av</code> argument is a
combination of <code>-a</code> (short for
<code>--archive</code>), which preserves
the file permissions in the copy you&rsquo;re making, and <code>-v</code> (short for - -<code>verbose</code>), which outputs each filename as it
copies the files. The <code>--progress</code> argument displays progress bars for
each file as it&rsquo;s copying. The <code>rsync</code> command will SSH into the server
<code>remote_host</code> with
the username <code>remote_user</code>. If it authenticates
successfully, it will download the file or folder at
<code>remote_path</code> and
save it on your computer at <code>local_path</code>.</p>
<p>For example, here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d download the Oath Keepers dataset from my
VPS to my <em>datasets</em> USB disk:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>rsync<span class="w"> </span>-av<span class="w"> </span>--progress<span class="w"> </span>root@178.128.22.151:<span class="s2">&quot;~/datasets/Oath\ Keepers&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span>/Volumes/datasets/
</code></pre></div>

<p>In this case, <code>root@178.128.22.151:"~/datasets/Oath\ Keepers"</code> is the <code>remote _user``@``remote_host``:``remote_path</code> argument, since the <em>Oath
Keepers</em> folder is in the <em>datasets</em> folder in the root user&rsquo;s home
folder on my VPS. I put the remote path in quotes and escape the space
in the filename, telling my local shell that
<code>root@178.128.22.151:"~/datasets/Oath\ Keepers"</code> is a single argument. The
<code>local_path</code> argument
is the <code>/media/micah/datasets/</code> path to my <em>datasets</em> USB disk.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>You can also use <code>rsync</code> to upload files from your
computer to a remote server&mdash;just put the <code>local_path</code>
argument first, as the source, and put the
<code>remote_user@remote_host:remote_path</code> argument second, as
the destination.</em></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the output I get when I run this command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>receiving incremental file list

--snip--
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>rsync</code> command copies every file, one at a
time, from the remote folder to the local folder over SSH, displaying a
line after each filename that shows the file&rsquo;s download speed and
progress. You can press <strong>CTRL</strong>-C to cancel the command, then
rerun that command, and <code>rsync</code> should continue where it left off.
This is especially useful when you need to copy gigabytes or terabytes
of data spread across millions of files&mdash;if the file transfer fails,
you can pick up where you left off.</p>
<p>Once <code>rsync</code> finishes running,
you&rsquo;ll have downloaded a local copy of the Oath Keepers dataset to your
<em>datasets</em> USB disk. You&rsquo;ll use this dataset again in Chapter 6, when you learn techniques for researching
email dumps.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong> <em>Destroy your VPS from the DigitalOcean web console when you&rsquo;re done
with it. Using it for an hour or two should cost you only a few cents,
but the bill can get expensive if you don&rsquo;t pay attention.</em></p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In this chapter, you&rsquo;ve put your command line skills to the test,
unzipping the compressed files in BlueLeaks and learning to quickly
search and sort datasets. You also worked with servers in the cloud and
briefly explored the Oath Keepers dataset.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, you&rsquo;ll continue expanding your command line skills
and learn two new tools: Docker, which allows you to run Linux software
on any operating system, and Aleph, which allows you to search datasets
by keyword.</p>
