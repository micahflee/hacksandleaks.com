          <h1>Chapter 6: Reading Other People’s Email</h1>
          <p>After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, hackers started flooding
DDoSecrets with stolen data from Russian organizations. The data came in
many formats, but the bulk of it&mdash;several terabytes&rsquo; worth&mdash;was email.
The entire inboxes of government agencies, oil and gas companies, and
investment firms were laid bare.</p>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section id="content" data-content="chapter-6">
        <div class="wrapper" id="about-content"><p>Email leaks are among the most common types of data leaks, and they can
have serious consequences. In the 2016 US presidential election between
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, leaked email messages from the DNC and
Clinton campaign chair John Podesta&mdash;both hacked by the Russian
government&mdash;played a major role in Trump&rsquo;s election. The 2020 US
presidential election between Trump and Joe Biden also involved email
leaks&mdash;in this case, stolen from the laptop of Biden&rsquo;s son Hunter.</p>
<p>With so many messages to sort through in email leaks, though, finding a
place to start can be overwhelming. Depending on how the email was
obtained and what software was running on the hacked server, the leaked
data could be in any of several different
formats, and it may not be clear how to access the messages it contains.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you&rsquo;ll learn about common formats for leaked email, the
benefits and shortcomings of indexing and searching email with Aleph,
and how to import email datasets into Thunderbird and Microsoft Outlook.
You&rsquo;ll sift through leaked email from the Oath Keepers dataset you
downloaded in Chapter 4, in addition to
datasets from Australian offshore detention centers and the conservative
US think tank the Heritage Foundation. We&rsquo;ll begin by taking a look at
the standard composition of an email message.</p>
<h3 id="the-email-protocol-and-message-structure">The Email Protocol and Message Structure<a class="headerlink" href="#the-email-protocol-and-message-structure" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>A <em>protocol</em> is a shared language that software developers agree upon to
make their code interoperate. The email protocol we use today was first
implemented in the early 1980s, got a major revamp in 1995, and hasn&rsquo;t
changed much since. Unlike modern centralized messaging systems
(Facebook Messenger, for example), this protocol allows anyone to run an
email server with their own software. For example, Google runs a server
at gmail.com, the Russian search engine Yandex runs one at
mail.yandex.com, and the Swiss company Proton runs one at proton.me.
These servers are powered by different software but communicate using
the same protocol, meaning they can all send messages to one another.
<em>Internet standards</em>, specifications for how certain types of software
should behave, ensure that all email software communicates with a shared
protocol and a shared message format.</p>
<p>Because the email message format is an internet standard, all messages
have a similar structure. To see what this format looks like, open any
email and choose <strong>Show Original</strong> or <strong>View Source</strong>. Each message is a
text file with two sections: the headers and body. The headers contain
an email&rsquo;s metadata in <code>Header-Field: Value</code> format, while the body
contains the main text of the message.</p>
<p>The following headers are included in nearly every email message:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Subject: What&#39;s up?
From: Alice &lt;alice@example.com&gt;
To: Bob &lt;bob@example.com&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<p>There are many more headers than these; your email software shows only a
few of them. When email servers send, forward, or receive messages, they
add headers describing these actions. For example, the common header
<code>DKIM-Signature</code> allows you to
verify, using cryptography, that an email actually came from the server
that it claims sent it. Messages also typically include a
<code>Content-Type</code> header, which
describes the format of the body text.</p>
<p>After the headers, the email includes a blank line followed by the body.
The body is typically in plaintext (text with no formatting), HTML, or
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) format. In MIME email,
the most common format, the body is split into
parts for text, HTML components, and email attachments.</p>
<p>Though email messages are text files, you can send binary files like
PNGs or ZIPs as attachments. Your email client converts the binary file
into text using <em>Base64</em> encoding and includes that encoded attachment
in the message. Just as you can convert any decimal number (that is, one
conveyed using 10 digits) into a binary number (conveyed using 2 digits)
and back, you can convert any binary data into Base64 data (conveyed
using 64 characters). For example, here&rsquo;s how a PNG image containing a
1×1 transparent pixel looks with each of its 86 bytes of data
represented as binary digits:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>10001001 01010000 01001110 01000111 00001101 00001010 00011010 00001010 00000000 00000000
00000000 00001101 01001001 01001000 01000100 01010010 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001 00001000 00000110 00000000 00000000 00000000 00011111
00010101 11000100 10001001 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000110 01100010 01001011 01000111
01000100 00000000 11111111 00000000 11111111 00000000 11111111 10100000 10111101 10100111
10010011 00000000 00000000 00000000 00001011 01001001 01000100 01000001 01010100 00001000
11010111 01100011 01100000 00000000 00000010 00000000 00000000 00000101 00000000 00000001
11100010 00100110 00000101 10011011 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 01001001 01000101
01001110 01000100 10101110 01000010 01100000 10000010
</code></pre></div>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the Base64-encoded version of the same binary file:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAABmJLR0QA/wD/AP+gvaeTAAAAC0lE
QVQI12NgAAIAAAUAAeImBZsAAAAASUVORK5CYII=
</code></pre></div>

<p>Base64-encoded data looks like a block of seemingly random text that
includes capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, plus signs
(<code>+</code>), and forward slashes
(<code>/</code>), and sometimes ends with
equal signs (<code>=</code>). The
Base64-encoded version of some data conveys the same information as the
decoded version, but it can be included more compactly in a text file,
like an email. When the recipient of the email loads it, their email
client will convert it from Base64 text back into a binary file.
Sometimes plaintext or HTML email is encoded in Base64 as well (for
example, <code>hello world</code> is
<code>aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=</code> in Base64).
Although email messages are text files, you can&rsquo;t rely on <code>grep</code> to search them, because much of the
content you&rsquo;re hunting for might be Base64-encoded.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind those basics, let&rsquo;s turn now to the specific formats
typically encountered in email leaks.</p>
<h3 id="file-formats-for-email-dumps">File Formats for Email Dumps<a class="headerlink" href="#file-formats-for-email-dumps" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The most common file formats for email <em>dumps</em>, or collections of email
messages, are EML files, MBOX files, and PST Outlook data files. You&rsquo;ll
download email in each format in the upcoming exercise.</p>
<h4 id="eml-files">EML Files<a class="headerlink" href="#eml-files" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The simplest type of email dump is a folder full of EML files, the
standard email message format. An EML file is a text file with the
extension <em>.eml</em> that contains the raw email message&mdash;the headers
followed by the body.</p>
<p>When you download an email from your personal account, it will be in EML
format. If you have a Gmail account, for example, open a message, click
the <strong>More</strong> menu (the three dots icon) in the upper-right corner, and
choose <strong>Download Message</strong>. Other email clients should likewise allow
you to download individual messages in EML format. You can sometimes
read an EML file in a text editor, but you&rsquo;ll frequently be stymied by
the Base64-encoded parts, so it&rsquo;s more useful to open it in an email
program like Thunderbird, Outlook, or the Mail app on macOS.</p>
<p>You can forward an email inline or as an attachment. Most email systems
default to forwarding inline, copying the text of the body of the email
you&rsquo;re forwarding into the body of the email you&rsquo;re writing. When you
instead forward as an attachment, you attach the raw EML file to the
email you&rsquo;re writing. From a Gmail inbox, for example, select the box
next to an email message, click the <strong>More</strong> menu, and choose <strong>Forward
as Attachment</strong>. Other email clients should allow you to forward email
as attachments as well. EML files include information that isn&rsquo;t
included in inline forwarded email, such as the original email headers.</p>
<p>EML files don&rsquo;t include information on how the email was organized in
the user&rsquo;s inbox, such as the folder where the email was stored. For
this reason, people who leak email dumps in EML format often organize
the files into folders, with each folder representing a different user&rsquo;s
inbox. Sometimes they organize the files from each inbox into
subfolders, too.</p>
<p>In Exercise 6-1, you&rsquo;ll download email messages in EML format from the
Nauru Police Force dataset.</p>
<h4 id="mbox-files">MBOX Files<a class="headerlink" href="#mbox-files" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>In an MBOX email dump, each file is a collection of many email messages,
generally representing a full folder of email. MBOX files often have the
file extension <em>.mbox</em>, but sometimes they have no file extension at
all.</p>
<p>Like EML files, MBOX files are text files that are viewable in a text
editor but not very human-readable because of the Base64 encoding.
However, you can&rsquo;t just open an MBOX file in an email client to read the
email like you can with an EML file. Instead, you&rsquo;ll need to import the
file.</p>
<p>The Oath Keepers dataset is a series of MBOX files, one for each hacked
inbox. I&rsquo;ll give more detail on the structure of this dataset in
Exercise 6-1.</p>
<h4 id="pst-outlook-data-files">PST Outlook Data Files<a class="headerlink" href="#pst-outlook-data-files" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Email dumps may also come in the form of PST files, a proprietary format
that represents a Microsoft Outlook inbox with the <em>.pst</em> file
extension. Microsoft&rsquo;s email server is called Microsoft Exchange.
Whenever an Outlook user wants to create a
backup of their email, or when an Exchange server is hacked, the data is
downloaded in PST format.</p>
<p>A PST file represents a full email inbox, complete with a hierarchy of
folders and their contents. These files can get <em>big</em>. For example, in
April 2022, hackers made off with 786GB of data from the All-Russia
State Television and Broadcasting Company (VGTRK), the largest
state-owned media company in Russia, and leaked it to DDoSecrets. This
dataset includes 252 PST files, each representing a different email
address. One file, <em>intercoord@vgtrk.ru.pst</em>, is 48GB alone.</p>
<p>In Exercise 6-1 you&rsquo;ll download a 1GB PST file containing email from the
Heritage Foundation.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-6-1-download-email-dumps-from-three-datasets">Exercise 6-1: Download Email Dumps from Three Datasets<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-6-1-download-email-dumps-from-three-datasets" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In this exercise, you&rsquo;ll work with three different datasets from the
Nauru Police Force, the Oath Keepers, and the Heritage Foundation. You
should already have the Oath Keepers dataset from Chapter
4, so you&rsquo;ll download the other two next.
You&rsquo;ll also learn more about their contents and structure.</p>
<h4 id="the-nauru-police-force-dataset">The Nauru Police Force Dataset<a class="headerlink" href="#the-nauru-police-force-dataset" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Nauru is a tiny island in the Pacific with a population of about 10,000.
While technically it&rsquo;s an independent country, it hosts abuse-ridden
offshore detention centers that the Australian government uses to hold
immigrants and asylum seekers. The Nauru Police Force dataset
(<a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Nauru_Police_Force">https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Nauru_Police_Force</a>)
is a 54GB torrent full of 127 ZIP files, each a copy of all of the email
from a specific email address at npf.gov.nr, the domain for the Nauru
Police Force. Inside each ZIP file is a collection of folders containing
EML files. This dataset contains over 285,000 messages.</p>
<p>For this chapter, you&rsquo;ll be working with the file <em>iven-notte.zip</em>,
which is about 2.9GB. Download the file directly from
<em><a href="https://data.ddosecrets.com/Nauru%20Police%20Force/npf.gov.nr/iven-notte.zip">https://data.ddosecrets.com/Nauru%20Police%20Force/npf.gov.nr/iven-notte.zip</a></em>.
Once you&rsquo;ve done so, save it into a folder called <em>Nauru Police Force</em>
on your <em>datasets</em> USB disk and unzip it. You should end up with a
folder called <em>iven-notte</em> containing the subfolders <em>calendar</em>,
<em>contacts</em>, <em>deleteditems</em>, <em>drafts</em>, <em>inbox</em>, and more. Each of these
subfolders is full of EML files.</p>
<h4 id="the-oath-keepers-dataset">The Oath Keepers Dataset<a class="headerlink" href="#the-oath-keepers-dataset" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The public part of the Oath Keepers dataset is a 3.9GB torrent of MBOX
files taken from the server that hosted email for the oathkeepers.org
domain. This dataset has a folder called <em>Oath Keepers.sbd</em>, containing
subfolders called <em>ak</em>, <em>al</em>, <em>alb</em>, <em>ar</em>, <em>Archive</em>, <em>az</em>, and many
others, each of which is an MBOX file (without the <em>.mbox</em> file
extension) that contains several email messages. Each US state chapter
of the Oath Keepers militia has its own inbox, so, for example, you can
find the Arizona chapter&rsquo;s email in the MBOX file <em>az</em>. There are a few
other MBOX files, including <em>volunteers</em> and <em>stewart.rhodes</em> (Stewart Rhodes is the founder
of the militia and was convicted of seditious conspiracy and sentenced
to 18 years in prison for his group&rsquo;s role in the January 6, 2021,
attack on the US Capitol). DDoSecrets distributes an additional part of
the dataset, which contains donor and membership records, only to
journalists and researchers who request access, because it contains so
much PII.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t already download the Oath Keepers dataset in Chapter
4, visit the DDoSecrets page for the Oath
Keepers at <a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Oath_Keepers">https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Oath_Keepers</a>.
This page includes a link to the torrent file as well as the magnet
link. Add the torrent to your BitTorrent client and download the full
dataset, saving it to your <em>datasets</em> USB disk.</p>
<h4 id="the-heritage-foundation-dataset">The Heritage Foundation Dataset<a class="headerlink" href="#the-heritage-foundation-dataset" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The Heritage Foundation is a conservative think tank that played a major
role in US politics during the Reagan administration. This dataset, a
1GB file called <em>backup.pst</em>, is a backup of a personal email account
used by an employee on the foundation&rsquo;s major gifts team. His email
address was hosted with his residential ISP at the domain
embarqmail.com. In 2015, the Twitter user @jfuller290
noticed that the foundation had accidentally put this backup in PST
format on a public Amazon S3 bucket&mdash;an Amazon cloud service that hosts
files&mdash;and he tweeted the link to it. (The Heritage Foundation at first
claimed that it was hacked, but in fact it had inadvertently made the
file public itself.) The email backup was made in 2009, six years before
@jfuller290 noticed it.</p>
<p>Visit the DDoSecrets page for the Heritage Foundation at
<a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Heritage_Foundation">https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Heritage_Foundation</a>.
This page includes links to the torrent as well as a direct download for
this dataset. Because the dataset is just a single, relatively small
Outlook Data File, directly download it from
<a href="https://data.ddosecrets.com/Heritage%20Foundation/backup.pst">https://data.ddosecrets.com/Heritage%20Foundation/backup.pst</a>
and save it into a folder called <em>Heritage Foundation</em> on your
<em>datasets</em> USB disk.</p>
<p>While you&rsquo;re waiting for these email dumps to finish downloading, read
on to learn about the tools you can use to research them.</p>
<h3 id="researching-email-dumps-with-thunderbird">Researching Email Dumps with Thunderbird<a class="headerlink" href="#researching-email-dumps-with-thunderbird" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Before you start reading the email you&rsquo;ve downloaded, you&rsquo;ll install and
configure <em>Thunderbird</em>, an open source email program for Windows,
macOS, and Linux that allows you to work with email dumps in different
formats. You can use Thunderbird to import folders full of EML or MBOX
files and search and read everything inside them. When you open an EML
file in Thunderbird, the program will parse the file, Base64-decode
everything for you, and let you see HTML email and download attachments.</p>
<p>Thunderbird users typically use the program just to check their personal
email, sometimes for multiple email accounts. If you want, you can add
your existing email accounts to it and use it to read and write email
yourself. For research purposes, though, you&rsquo;ll
use Thunderbird to import email into <em>local folders</em>, which will allow
you to work with the email locally on your computer without connecting
to an email server. You don&rsquo;t need internet access when using
Thunderbird to research email dumps in this way, which means you can use
an air-gapped computer.</p>
<p>Like its sister project, the Firefox web browser, Thunderbird supports
third-party extensions that add functionality to the program. The
ImportExportTools NG extension is crucial to working with email dumps;
it adds support for importing MBOX files and for bulk-importing folders
full of EML files, keeping their folder structure intact. However, to
import PSTs into Thunderbird, you must first convert them into EMLs
using the <code>readpst</code> program.
You&rsquo;ll import all three file types into Thunderbird later in the
chapter.</p>
<p>After importing email dumps into Thunderbird, you can click through all
of the folders and read the email messages as if you were reading your
own email. You can also use Thunderbird&rsquo;s built-in search feature to
bulk-search all of the email you&rsquo;ve imported. However, you can&rsquo;t use
Thunderbird to search the content of attachments&mdash;for that, you&rsquo;ll need
a tool like Aleph, which we&rsquo;ll discuss in Other Tools for Researching
Email Dumps on page 163.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-6-2-configure-thunderbird-for-email-dumps">Exercise 6-2: Configure Thunderbird for Email Dumps<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-6-2-configure-thunderbird-for-email-dumps" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In this exercise, you&rsquo;ll install Thunderbird and configure it in order
to analyze the three email dumps you&rsquo;ve downloaded.</p>
<p>Download Thunderbird from <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net">https://www.thunderbird.net</a>
and install it on your computer. When you open the program the first
time, it asks if you want to set up an existing email account. While you
won&rsquo;t need to use a real email account to research email dumps, adding
an account to Thunderbird makes it easier to import these data dumps
later on. If you don&rsquo;t want to use Thunderbird to check your real email,
I recommend that you create a new email account just for this purpose.
Click the <strong>Get a New Email Address</strong> link to create a new free email
account directly within Thunderbird on an email provider called
Mailfence. Select an email address and generate a random password in
your password manager, then provide an existing email address to
activate your new account. After creating your account, log in to it
with Thunderbird, and you should see the message &ldquo;Account successfully
created.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next, switch to the main Thunderbird tab. In the Folders sidebar on the
left, you should see the email address you added, and beneath it a
section called Local Folders. You added an email address just to create
the Local Folders section, so if you don&rsquo;t plan on using Thunderbird to
check this email account, you can delete it. To do so, click the
Thunderbird menu icon in the top-right corner and choose <strong>Account
Settings</strong>. Make sure your new email account is selected, click
<strong>Account Actions</strong> in the bottom left, and choose <strong>Remove Account</strong>.
Select the <strong>Remove Message Data</strong> box and click
<strong>Remove</strong>. Now switch back to the main Thunderbird window, and only
Local Folders should remain in the left sidebar.</p>
<p>Next, to install the ImportExportTools NG Thunderbird add-on, click the
menu icon in the top-right corner and choose <strong>Add-ons and Themes</strong>.
Switch to the <strong>Extensions</strong> tab, search for <strong>ImportExportTools NG</strong>,
and install the add-on. A lot of this add-on&rsquo;s functionality appears in
the Tools menu bar at the top, which appears automatically in macOS. To
access it in Windows or Linux, click the menu icon in the top-right
corner and choose
<strong>View</strong> ▸ <strong>Toolbars</strong> ▸ <strong>Menu Bar</strong>. A menu
bar should appear at the top of the Thunderbird window. Go to
<strong>Tools</strong> ▸ <strong>ImportExportTools NG</strong> to access the add-on&rsquo;s
features.</p>
<p>Finally, click the Thunderbird menu icon and choose <strong>Settings</strong>. Switch
to the <strong>Privacy &amp; Security</strong> tab and make sure that Allow Remote
Content in Messages is unchecked (it should be unchecked by default).
<em>Remote content</em> is any content hosted on the internet instead of inside
of the email, like images loaded from URLs. When you open an email with
remote content, like an HTML email with images, loading those images
will leave a trace that the email was opened from a certain IP address.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>Thunderbird will always give you the chance to load remote content on
individual email messages if you&rsquo;d like, but I recommend that you
connect to a VPN beforehand so that the VPN&rsquo;s IP address, rather than
your IP address, will be tracked (see the &ldquo;Covering Your Tracks with a
VPN Service&rdquo; box on page 255).</em></p>
<h3 id="reading-individual-eml-files-with-thunderbird">Reading Individual EML Files with Thunderbird<a class="headerlink" href="#reading-individual-eml-files-with-thunderbird" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>During your own investigations, you may find only a few EML files in a
dataset, or someone might forward email messages to you as attachments.
Thunderbird is a good tool for inspecting these messages individually
without needing to import them.</p>
<p>Once your downloads from Exercise 6-1 have finished, try using
Thunderbird to view some individual messages. Open your file manager
app, like Explorer in Windows or Finder in macOS, and browse to the
extracted <em>iven-notte</em> folder in the Nauru Police Force dataset. Open
the <em>inbox</em> folder, right-click one of the EML files, and open it in
Thunderbird. Thunderbird should show you the headers, like the date the
email was sent, and the From, To, and Subject lines. You can also read
the email exactly as it was originally formatted, and if it has
attachments, you can open them.</p>
<p>Just as you shouldn&rsquo;t blindly open attachments you receive in your
personal email, don&rsquo;t blindly open attachments that you find in email
dumps, because they could hack your computer. Refer back to Chapter
1 for tips on how to open such documents
safely.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="extracting-attachments-from-eml-files">EXTRACTING ATTACHMENTS FROM EML FILES<a class="headerlink" href="#extracting-attachments-from-eml-files" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>A single EML file could contain several file attachments, all Base64-encoded. The <code>munpack</code>
program lets you extract these attachments without needing to use an email client. Install <code>munpack</code> with <code>sudo apt install mpack</code>
in Linux or Windows with WSL, or use <code>brew install mpack</code> in Homebrew on macOS. You can then run the command <code>munpack filename.eml</code>
to extract the attachments from an email.</p>
<p>For example, the Nauru Police Force dataset contains an EML file called <code>68.eml</code>. When I run <code>munpack 68.eml</code>, it extracts the attachments from that email&mdash;in this case, <code>RegistrationXForm.pdf</code> and <code>COPXPassport.pdf</code>&mdash;into the current working folder. You could also use <code>munpack</code> in a script to extract all of the attachments from every email message in an email dump, all from the terminal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the following exercises, you&rsquo;ll import each of the email dumps you
just downloaded into Thunderbird, starting with the EML files from the
Nauru Police Force dataset.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-6-3-import-the-nauru-police-force-eml-email-dump">Exercise 6-3: Import the Nauru Police Force EML Email Dump<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-6-3-import-the-nauru-police-force-eml-email-dump" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>To import an email dump with the ImportExportTools NG add-on, select the
folder into which you&rsquo;d like to import it. Always import email dumps
into a local folder, rather than a remote folder on an email server.
From the Folders sidebar on the main Thunderbird tab, right-click
<strong>Local Folders</strong> and choose <strong>New Folder</strong>, as shown in Figure
6-1.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 6-1: Creating a new local folder in Thunderbird" src="media/images/Figure6-1.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 6-1: Creating a new local folder in Thunderbird</em></p>
<p>Name your folder <em>Nauru Police Force</em> and click <strong>Create Folder</strong>. You
should now see the <em>Nauru Police Force</em> folder in your Local Folders
list.</p>
<p>Right-click the <em>Nauru Police Force</em> folder you
just created and choose <strong>New Subfolder</strong>. Name your subfolder
<em>iven-notte</em>, the name of the email account whose inbox data you&rsquo;ll be
importing, and click <strong>Create Folder</strong>. Right-click the new <em>iven-notte</em>
subfolder that you just created and choose <strong>ImportExportTools
NG</strong> ▸ <strong>Import EML Messages</strong> ▸ <strong>All EML
Messages from a Directory and Subdirectories</strong>. A dialog will pop up,
allowing you to browse for a folder. Select your <em>iven-notte</em> subfolder.</p>
<p>This subfolder should immediately start filling up with the 14,964 email
messages that you&rsquo;re importing. It will probably take a few minutes to
finish (importing all 127 inboxes in this dataset would take
considerably longer).</p>
<p>Figure 6-2 shows Thunderbird with the
<em>iven-notte</em> inbox loaded up. You can see all of the folders and the
number of unread messages in each. (If you&rsquo;d like, you can mark all of
these messages as unread to keep track of which messages you have left
to read.)</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 6-2: An email dump imported in Thunderbird" src="media/images/Figure6-2.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 6-2: An email dump imported in Thunderbird</em></p>
<p>The email selected in Figure 6-2 is in the
<em>inbox</em> folder and was sent from Lionel Aingimea, the president of Nauru
at that time. In the email, he instructs Iven Notte, the Nauru police
chief and the inbox owner, to not respond to Australian journalist Eden
Gillespie, who had asked about two Nauru men
who had allegedly attacked a refugee worker, possibly run him over, and
stolen his motorbike. &ldquo;Leave it,&rdquo; President Aingimea wrote. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
answer them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cam Wilson, a reporter for the Australian news site Crikey, dug into the
Nauru Police Force dataset and revealed &ldquo;the appalling disregard for
refugees and asylum seekers detained there.&rdquo; You can read Wilson&rsquo;s
reporting on Crikey&rsquo;s website, <a href="https://www.crikey.com.au">https://www.crikey.com.au</a>.</p>
<h3 id="searching-email-in-thunderbird">Searching Email in Thunderbird<a class="headerlink" href="#searching-email-in-thunderbird" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve got Thunderbird configured and loaded with data, you&rsquo;re
ready to explore that data. For example, you may want to search the
Nauru Police Force dataset for other email from President Aingimea or
from Australian politicians. You could also search for email that
contains keywords like <em>refugee</em> or was written on specific days. This
section covers search methods you can use on any email dump you import
into Thunderbird.</p>
<h4 id="quick-filter-searches">Quick Filter Searches<a class="headerlink" href="#quick-filter-searches" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The simplest search option is to filter the email that shows up in the
currently selected folder. When viewing a folder, near the top of the
Thunderbird window, make sure the Quick Filter button is toggled on so
that an extra toolbar appears. This toolbar has buttons to quickly
filter out only messages that are unread, contain attachments, or have
other properties.</p>
<p>The Quick Filter toolbar also has a search box that you can use to find
only messages that include certain text. You can also filter for
messages that include the search term in the sender field, recipient
field, subject line, or body. This is the most common way I search in
Thunderbird. For example, I entered <em>Aingimea</em> in the Quick Filter
search box to quickly find all of the email related to President
Aingimea in the <em>inbox</em> folder. I could also put his email address in
the search box and filter for messages where he&rsquo;s the sender or the
recipient (though he won&rsquo;t be the recipient of any of this email,
because this is Iven Notte&rsquo;s inbox, not his).</p>
<h4 id="the-search-messages-dialog">The Search Messages Dialog<a class="headerlink" href="#the-search-messages-dialog" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The Quick Filter search is essentially a more limited version of the
Search Messages dialog, which is the most powerful way to search for
email in Thunderbird. Open this dialog by clicking the <strong>Edit</strong> menu and
choosing <strong>Find</strong> ▸ <strong>Search Messages</strong>. You can choose
which folder to search, or you can elect to search all the email in an
account at once. You can then choose more granular search queries. For
example, you could find all email messages that mention <em>asylum</em> in the
body. You can then filter those results by adding further criteria, such
as showing only email sent from or to a specific email address or only
email with attachments.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a search box in the top right of
the Thunderbird window, above the Quick Filter search box, that will
quickly search the full email account. I find this feature less useful
than the Search Messages dialog. If I can&rsquo;t find what I&rsquo;m looking for
with Quick Filter, I move on to Search Messages, which lets me make my
searches as granular as necessary.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-6-4-import-the-oath-keepers-mbox-email-dump">Exercise 6-4: Import the Oath Keepers MBOX Email Dump<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-6-4-import-the-oath-keepers-mbox-email-dump" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In this exercise, you&rsquo;ll import email from the Oath Keepers dataset into
Thunderbird. The Oath Keepers dataset contains the files <em>messages.json</em>
and <em>messages_old.json</em>, which are chat logs, and the <em>Oath
Keepers.sbd</em> folder, which contains 100 files in MBOX format. You&rsquo;ll
focus on the latter here. As mentioned previously, you can&rsquo;t open MBOX
files in an email client to read the messages like you can with EML
files; you must import them into Thunderbird first.</p>
<p>To keep your different datasets separate in Thunderbird, you&rsquo;ll create a
new folder for the Oath Keepers data. In the left panel, right-click
<strong>Local Folders</strong> and choose <strong>New Folder</strong>. Name your folder <em>Oath
Keepers</em> and click <strong>Create Folder</strong>. You should now see the <em>Oath
Keepers</em> folder in your Local Folders list. Right-click the <em>Oath
Keepers</em> folder you just created and choose <strong>ImportExportTools
NG</strong> ▸ <strong>Import mbox Files</strong> ▸ <strong>All mbox Files
from directory (with sbd structure)</strong>. Browse your filesystem and select
the <em>Oath Keepers.sbd</em> folder.</p>
<p>Thunderbird might become unresponsive while it imports the 3.9GB of
email, not allowing you to click on anything, but be patient. When the
import is complete, you should have 100 separate folders full of email.</p>
<p>The Oath Keepers folder with the most email, by far, is <em>oksupport</em>, the
Oath Keepers support email account. Figure 6-3
shows an email in this folder from a member renouncing his membership
shortly after the January 6 attack.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t found many major revelations in this email dump; most of those
are contained in the private part of the Oath Keepers database, the
membership and donor lists that DDoSecrets distributes only to
journalists and researchers. The publicly available email contains many
people writing about joining the militia or complaining that they paid
their membership dues but haven&rsquo;t had any further communication. There&rsquo;s
also a massive amount of spam, including right-wing extremist,
conspiratorial, and anti-vaccine bulk email. Look through the various
email accounts you imported and try out Thunderbird&rsquo;s search tools to
see if you can find anything interesting I missed.</p>

<h3 id="exercise-6-5-import-the-heritage-foundation-pst-email-dump">Exercise 6-5: Import the Heritage Foundation PST Email Dump<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-6-5-import-the-heritage-foundation-pst-email-dump" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In this exercise, you&rsquo;ll import the Heritage Foundation email dump, a
Microsoft Outlook PST file called <em>backup.pst</em>, into Thunderbird. Since
the ImportExportTools NG add-on doesn&rsquo;t support PST files, first you&rsquo;ll
need to convert the PST into an EML or MBOX file.</p>
<p>The <code>readpst</code> program can
convert a PST file into several different formats, including EML and
MBOX files. You can access the program by installing the
<code>libpst</code> package in macOS or
the <code>pst-utils</code> package in
Ubuntu. Start by opening a terminal. Mac users, run the following
command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>libpst
</code></pre></div>

<p>Linux and Windows with WSL users, run these commands:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt<span class="w"> </span>update
sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>pst-utils
</code></pre></div>

<p>Next, change to the folder that contains the
<em>backup.pst</em> file. For example, on my macOS computer, I run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>/Volumes/datasets/Heritage<span class="se">\ </span>Foundation
</code></pre></div>

<p>To convert a PST file into EML file, you use the following command,
where the <code>-e</code> argument tells
<code>readpst</code> to output as EML
files:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>readpst<span class="w"> </span>-e<span class="w"> </span>filename.pst
</code></pre></div>

<p>Run that command on the <em>backup.pst</em> file like so:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>readpst<span class="w"> </span>-e<span class="w"> </span>backup.pst
</code></pre></div>

<p>This command creates a folder called <em>Personal Folders</em>, which contains
additional <em>Contacts</em>, <em>Heritage</em>, <em>Inbox</em>, <em>Junk E-mail</em>, and other
subfolders (this is how the email in <em>backup.pst</em> is organized). Within
each folder are several EML files, one for each email message.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>I&rsquo;ve found it easier to import EML files generated by <code>readpst</code> into Thunderbird, but you can
also convert PSTs into MBOX files with the</em> <code>readpst -r filename.pst</code> <em>command.</em></p>
<p>In the left panel, right-click <strong>Local Folders</strong> and choose <strong>New
Folder</strong>, as you did in the previous exercises. Name your folder
<em>Heritage Foundation</em> and click <strong>Create Folder</strong>. You should now see
the <em>Heritage Foundation</em> folder in your Local Folders list.</p>
<p>Right-click the <em>Heritage Foundation</em> folder, choose <strong>New Subfolder</strong>,
and name your new subfolder <em>backup.pst</em>. Right-click the <em>backup.pst</em>
subfolder and choose <strong>ImportExportTools NG</strong> ▸ <strong>Import EML
Messages</strong> ▸ <strong>All EML Messages from a Directory and
Subdirectories</strong>. Browse for the <em>Personal Folders</em> folder that you just
created using <code>readpst</code> and
start the import. This folder should start filling up with over a
thousand email messages.</p>
<p>These email messages, all belonging to former Heritage Foundation
fundraiser Steve DeBuhr, are meticulously organized into folders. In
addition to Heritage Foundation work, this email dump also includes
DeBuhr&rsquo;s personal email. This email dump is very old&mdash;the latest
messages are from 2009&mdash;so it&rsquo;s unlikely you&rsquo;ll find very many
revelations in here. Since DeBuhr worked with major donors, though, the
email in the <em>Heritage</em> folder contains many attachments full of
financial details. Figure 6-4 shows this email
dump in Thunderbird.</p>
<p>Particularly, I noticed as I browsed through this email that the <em>Social
Issues</em> folder contains homophobic and otherwise bigoted messages that
DeBuhr had forwarded from his official heritage.org address account to
his personal one.</p>

<h3 id="other-tools-for-researching-email-dumps">Other Tools for Researching Email Dumps<a class="headerlink" href="#other-tools-for-researching-email-dumps" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>This chapter has focused on using Thunderbird as a tool for researching
email dumps, but in your future work, you might find two alternative
tools helpful: Microsoft Outlook and Aleph. In this section I&rsquo;ll go over
how you can use each tool to import and search email dumps. You don&rsquo;t
need to follow the instructions in this section to work through the rest
of the book, but reading along will give you a sense of what the options
are and when to use them.</p>
<h4 id="microsoft-outlook">Microsoft Outlook<a class="headerlink" href="#microsoft-outlook" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Unlike Thunderbird, Microsoft&rsquo;s desktop email program, Outlook, supports
importing email dumps directly in PST format. However, Outlook has some
downsides. First, it&rsquo;s not free; the cheapest way to get Outlook is to
buy a Microsoft 365 license, which, at the time of writing, costs around
$7 per month or $70 per year. Second, Outlook is available only for
Windows and macOS, not Linux (though Linux users can run Outlook in a
Windows VM). Still, you might find Outlook useful if you&rsquo;re familiar
with the program and understand its advanced
features, or just want to see an email in its original interface.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at how to import PST files directly into Outlook, using a
real example from a hacked Russian email dump. First, set up a Windows
VM for Outlook. Do this even if you&rsquo;re a Windows or macOS user who
already uses Outlook for email, in order to avoid mixing up your actual
email and a leaked email dump. Microsoft publishes free Windows VM
images for several different VM programs like VirtualBox, VMWare, and
Parallels. Download the VM image at
<a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/">https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/</a>
and import it into your VM software. You&rsquo;ll also need to install
Microsoft Office in your VM. If you have a Microsoft 365 license,
download Office from
<a href="https://www.office.com">https://www.office.com</a>
by logging in and clicking the <strong>Install Office</strong> link. If you don&rsquo;t
have a license, Microsoft offers a free trial.</p>
<p>When you open Outlook the first time, it prompts you to log in to your
Office 365 account to check your license. After that, it prompts you to
set up an email account. At the bottom, click the link <strong>Create an
Outlook.com Email Address to Get Started</strong> in order to create a new
account. Make sure to save your email and password in your password
manager. Once you&rsquo;re finished, click <strong>Done</strong>. Outlook should open with
the empty inbox of the new email account you just created.</p>
<p>With Outlook set up, add the PST email dumps to it. Click
<strong>File</strong> ▸ <strong>Account Settings</strong> ▸ <strong>Account
Settings</strong>, then click <strong>Data Files</strong> ▸ <strong>Add</strong> and browse
for the PST file you want to add. If you have the disk space to spare,
make a copy of the PST file and add the copy instead. All information
about this inbox, including details like which messages are marked read,
is stored in this file, so working from a copy will prevent you from
modifying the original.</p>
<p>The PST file you added should appear in the left sidebar. You can now
sift through this inbox as if it were your own. Even the unread email
counts you&rsquo;ll see are the actual counts of unread email for each folder
at the time the PST file was exported.</p>
<p>As an example, I set up a Windows VM, installed Outlook, logged in to it
using my Microsoft 365 account, and added <em>intercoord@vgtrk.ru.pst</em>
(the 48GB PST file hacked from VGTRK mentioned earlier in this chapter).</p>
<p>Figure 6-5 shows this VGTRK inbox, where I&rsquo;ve
used Outlook&rsquo;s search feature to search for Такер Карлсон. This is the Cyrillic spelling of Tucker Carlson,
the former Fox News host.</p>
<p>The subject line of the selected email in Figure
6-5 translates roughly to &ldquo;Tucker Carlson
sync.&rdquo; The email body contains a translated quote in which Carlson
claims that Ukraine is not an independent country, but rather is
controlled by the US Democratic Party. The quote also includes the false
claim that in 2016, then Vice President Joe Biden fired Ukraine&rsquo;s
attorney general for investigating Biden&rsquo;s son Hunter. (In fact, Biden
leveraged $1 billion in US aid to persuade Ukraine to oust its top
prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who refused to investigate corruption from
powerful Ukrainians. Biden worked in tandem with anti-corruption efforts
across Europe: European leaders, as well as civil society groups within
Ukraine, urged Shokin to resign for the same reason.) Russian TV likely
aired this Tucker Carlson clip, and this email was likely the
translation for their Russian dubbed version.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 6-5: Researching a PST file in Outlook" src="media/images/Figure6-5.png" />{#fig6-5
.img100}</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>When working with data dumps in foreign languages that you don&rsquo;t read,
you can rely on machine translation tools like DeepL or Google
Translate&mdash;assuming, of course, that you&rsquo;re comfortable sharing the
contents of the leak with a third-party service. I&rsquo;ve also found the
Google Translate phone app useful: if you hold your phone&rsquo;s camera up to
your screen, it will translate text in real time. This works even with
scanned documents that aren&rsquo;t OCR&rsquo;d.</em></p>
<h4 id="aleph">Aleph<a class="headerlink" href="#aleph" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>As you learned in Chapter 5, you can use
Aleph to index and browse a wide variety of email, including PST or EML
files. When you index a folder containing PSTs, Aleph recognizes the
file format and indexes all of the individual messages inside of each
PST file, keeping the folder hierarchy intact. Aleph also has the
following benefits for working with email dumps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike Thunderbird and Outlook, Aleph will also index, make
    searchable, and even add OCR to email attachments.</li>
<li>As with any dataset it processes, Aleph will automatically list all
    of the people and organizations it finds in the dataset, and you can
    use it to cross-reference that data with other datasets you&rsquo;ve
    indexed.</li>
<li>If you run an Aleph server for a group of
    researchers, you can easily enable them to search email dumps; all
    they need is a web browser and an Aleph account.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using Aleph for email dumps has a few downsides. First, it requires a
lot of technical work to spin up an Aleph server and to index datasets,
especially if you plan on putting it on the internet for others to use.
In my experience, if you try to import large datasets like email dumps
into Aleph, you&rsquo;re likely to run into technical hurdles with your Docker
setup. Using Thunderbird is a simpler solution.</p>
<p>Aleph also can&rsquo;t properly index MBOX files; it tries to index them as
text files rather than as collections of different email messages. It
won&rsquo;t do any Base64-decoding of the data inside MBOX files, so it&rsquo;s not
much more useful than <code>grep</code>
for this task. If you want an MBOX-formatted email dump indexed in your
Aleph server, import it into Thunderbird and then export it again (using
ImportExportTools NG) in EML format.</p>
<p>Aleph has other quirks that make working with email dumps more
complicated. For example, if there&rsquo;s an email attachment in a format
Aleph doesn&rsquo;t understand, it just won&rsquo;t display the attachment at all
when you view that email message. If you want to be sure you&rsquo;re seeing
everything in the email, download an individual EML file from Aleph and
open it in Thunderbird.</p>
<p>In sum, Outlook is a reasonable choice for PST files, and Aleph is a
good choice if you&rsquo;re working with groups of people or want to
cross-reference an email dump with other datasets. However, Thunderbird
is the simplest way to quickly start your email dump investigation, and
it supports all email formats.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In this chapter, you learned how to import email dumps in the EML, MBOX,
and PST formats into Thunderbird to read and search them. You read an
email from the president of Nauru, got insights into the type of email
the Oath Keepers receive, and explored an old email dump from the
Heritage Foundation. You also saw how to use Microsoft Outlook and Aleph
as alternatives to Thunderbird. You can use the skills you&rsquo;ve learned
here in your future email dump investigations.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, you&rsquo;ll level up your technical skills for analyzing
datasets by taking a crash course in Python programming.</p>
