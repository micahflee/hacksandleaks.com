          <h1>Chapter 9: BlueLeaks, Black Lives Matter, and the CSV File Format</h1>
          <p>The BlueLeaks dataset is full of an overwhelming number of documents,
but it&rsquo;s not immediately obvious where to start or how to make sense of
the data they contain. Before beginning an investigation, I needed a way
to efficiently determine the significance of these documents. After
manually digging through many files, I discovered that the context I
needed was in the hundreds of CSV spreadsheets in each BlueLeaks folder.
In this chapter, you&rsquo;ll learn how to investigate CSV files like these
yourself.</p>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section id="content" data-content="chapter-9">
        <div class="wrapper" id="about-content"><p>You&rsquo;ll view CSVs in both graphical spreadsheet and text editing
software, write Python code to loop through the rows of a CSV, and save
CSVs of your own. You&rsquo;ll then put this knowledge into practice by
digging through the CSVs in the BlueLeaks dataset, focusing on data from
the NCRIC fusion center. This is the data I myself have primarily
focused on since BlueLeaks was published
years ago, but there are over a hundred other folders in the dataset
full of newsworthy revelations. By the end of this chapter, you&rsquo;ll have
the tools to continue investigating these folders, as well as similar
datasets loaded with CSVs.</p>
<h3>Installing Spreadsheet Software</h3>
<p>The most user-friendly way to view the contents of a CSV file is to open
it using spreadsheet software such as LibreOffice Calc, Microsoft Excel,
Apple Numbers, or Google Sheets. Spreadsheet software is a great option
to see the data you&rsquo;re dealing with in an organized way, and it can also
be a powerful tool to analyze CSVs. However, in many cases, depending on
the data you&rsquo;re working with, you&rsquo;ll need to go beyond such software and
write custom code to work with CSVs.</p>
<p>If you already have a favorite spreadsheet program, you can use that for
the projects in this book. If not, I suggest using LibreOffice Calc
since it&rsquo;s free, open source, and available for Windows, macOS, and
Linux; it&rsquo;s also what I&rsquo;ve used for the examples in this chapter.
Installing LibreOffice
(<a href="https://www.libreoffice.org">https://www.libreoffice.org</a>)
installs a whole suite of office software, including Calc.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Microsoft Excel is a good option, but it costs money and
isn&rsquo;t available for Linux. If you have a Mac, you can also use Apple&rsquo;s
free spreadsheet software, Numbers. Finally, you can consider using
Google Sheets, the spreadsheet feature of Google Docs. Google Docs is
free and works in Windows, macOS, and Linux, since it&rsquo;s web-based. The
problem with Google Sheets and any other cloud-based spreadsheet
software (like the web-based version of Microsoft Excel) is that you
have to upload a copy of your CSV file to a third-party service before
you can view it. For public datasets like BlueLeaks, this is okay.
However, it&rsquo;s better to use desktop spreadsheet software when you&rsquo;re
dealing with more sensitive datasets.</p>
<p>Spreadsheet software, when used with more complicated spreadsheet
formats such as Microsoft Excel files (<em>.xlsx</em>) or ODF Spreadsheet files
(<em>.ods</em>), is powerful and feature-rich. It can do math, like summing all
of the values in a column, and visualize data, like creating pie charts
or line graphs. None of these features are supported in CSV files,
though, so I won&rsquo;t discuss them in this book.</p>
<p>Once you have your spreadsheet software installed, you&rsquo;re ready to learn
more about the structure of CSV files.</p>
<h3>Introducing the CSV File Format</h3>
<p>You can think of spreadsheets as tables of data. The top row normally
has headers for each column, and the rest of the rows represent data
that matches those headers. CSV is the simplest spreadsheet format. You
can open CSV files using software like Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice
Calc, or you can view them in a text editor and use CLI tools like
<code>grep</code> to search them.</p>
<p>BlueLeaks is full of CSV files, but the
original data from the fusion center websites wasn&rsquo;t in that format. The
BlueLeaks dataset includes source code for those websites, and by
reviewing that, I discovered that each site had actually stored its data
in a Microsoft Access database file. The BlueLeaks hacker exported
tables from the Access databases and saved that data in CSV format
before leaking it to DDoSecrets.</p>
<p>CSV files are simply text files made up of multiple lines representing
rows in a table. Each line contains a list of values, usually separated
by commas (hence the name <em>comma-separated values</em>), with each value
representing a <em>cell</em> in the spreadsheet. Sometimes a spreadsheet row is
referred to as a <em>record</em>, with each cell in that row referred to as a
<em>field</em> in that record. Typically, each row contains the same number of
cells.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example CSV file called <em>city-populations.csv</em>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>City,Country,Population
Tōkyō,Japan,37400000
Delhi,India,28514000
Shanghai,China,25582000
São Paulo,Brazil,21650000
Mexico City,Mexico,21581000
Cairo,Egypt,20076000
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can find a copy of this file in the book&rsquo;s GitHub repository at
<a href="https://github.com/micahflee/hacks-leaks-and-revelations/blob/main/chapter-9/city-populations.csv">https://github.com/micahflee/hacks-leaks-and-revelations/blob/main/chapter-9/city-populations.csv</a>.
I&rsquo;ll use this file as an example CSV later in this chapter, so download
it now (or re-enter it) and save it in a folder for this chapter&rsquo;s
exercises.</p>
<p>Table 9-1 shows the data from the <em>city-populations.csv</em> file organized into rows and columns.</p>
<p><em>Table 9-1: City Populations</em></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>City</strong></th>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>When a value includes commas, it must be surrounded by quotation marks.
For example, the values &ldquo;Hello, World&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hola, Mundo&rdquo; both contain
commas. Here&rsquo;s how they look in a CSV file along with fields for their
respective languages:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Language,Greeting
English,&quot;Hello, World&quot;
Español,&quot;Hola, Mundo&quot;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Table 9-2 shows this data organized into rows and columns.</p>
<p><em>Translations of “Hello, World”</em></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Language</th>
<th>Greeting</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>English</td>
<td>Hello, World</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Español</td>
<td>Hola, Mundo</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It&rsquo;s common to enclose every value in quotes, regardless of whether it
includes commas. Here&rsquo;s another version of the previous spreadsheet, now
with every value in quotes:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>&quot;Language&quot;,&quot;Greeting&quot;
&quot;English&quot;,&quot;Hello, World&quot;
&quot;Español&quot;,&quot;Hola, Mundo&quot;
</code></pre></div>

<p>As with shell scripting and Python programming, you can escape quotes in
CSVs by using a backslash and double quotes (<code>\"</code>). For example, the value
<code>"Not I," said the cow</code> contains both quotes and commas, so to add it to a CSV file you would
surround the entire value in quotes and escape the inner quotes, like
this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>&quot;\&quot;Not I,\&quot; said the cow&quot;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Because the CSV file format is so simple, it&rsquo;s one of the most commonly
used spreadsheet formats, especially for anyone working with
spreadsheets using code. Like CSVs, SQL databases also store <em>tabular
data</em> (data that can be represented in a table), so CSVs are a
convenient format for exporting tables from them. In fact, all of the
CSVs in BlueLeaks are exported SQL tables from the databases that power
law enforcement and fusion center websites. (You&rsquo;ll learn about SQL
databases in Chapter 12; for now, you&rsquo;ll
work with the exported CSVs.)</p>
<p>Now that you understand a bit about the CSV file format, let&rsquo;s take a
look at some real CSV data from BlueLeaks.</p>
<h3>Exploring CSV Files with Spreadsheet Software and Text Editors</h3>
<p>In your graphical file browser (such as Explorer in Windows or Finder in
macOS), browse to the <em>BlueLeaks-extracted</em> folder on your USB disk.
You&rsquo;ll start by examining the <em>dediac</em> subfolder, which contains data
from the Delaware Information Analysis Center. Scroll through the files
in this folder&mdash;nearly all of them are CSVs&mdash;and open <em>Documents.csv</em>
in your graphical spreadsheet software.</p>
<p>When you open a file in LibreOffice Calc or
other spreadsheet software, you&rsquo;ll likely be presented with a window
asking you to confirm the settings for this CSV. Figure
9-1 shows the window that pops up when I open
<em>Documents.csv</em> in LibreOffice Calc on my Mac.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 9-1: The LibreOffice Calc Text Import settings" src="media/images/Figure9-1.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 9-1: The LibreOffice Calc Text Import settings</em></p>
<p>The most important setting to select is the correct separator character,
which is, in this and most cases, a comma (<code>,</code>). Some CSVs separate values with
characters other than commas, like semicolons (<code>;</code>) or tabs (<code>\t</code>), though this is rare. In the future
if you aren&rsquo;t sure which character your CSV uses, you can open the CSV
in a text editor first to check.</p>
<p>Click <strong>OK</strong> to open the spreadsheet. This one should open quickly, but
sometimes CSVs are huge&mdash;hundreds of mega- or gigabytes&mdash;so you may
need to wait several seconds, or even minutes, for a large CSV to finish
loading.</p>
<p>Figure 9-2 shows part
of the <em>Documents.csv</em> spreadsheet in LibreOffice Calc.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 9-2: Viewing Documents.csv in LibreOffice Calc" src="media/images/Figure9-2.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 9-2: Viewing Documents.csv in LibreOffice Calc</em></p>
<p>This spreadsheet has 23 columns and 6,934 rows (one of which is the
header row). At the top of the file, the dates in the DateEntered column
are from 2011. You can find the most recent data in a spreadsheet by
<em>sorting</em> it, either in ascending (from smaller to bigger) or descending
(bigger to smaller) order. I&rsquo;ll show you how to sort this spreadsheet in
LibreOffice Calc, but the instructions should be similar for other
spreadsheet software and apply to any spreadsheet you want to sort.</p>
<p>First, since you don&rsquo;t want to sort the header row, click
<strong>View</strong> ▸ <strong>Freeze Cells</strong> ▸ <strong>Freeze First
Row</strong>. This should freeze the header row, so now when you scroll up and
down, the headers will remain at the top of the file.</p>
<p>Next, you need to pick which column you want to sort by. To see the most
recent documents at the top, sort by DateEntered descending. Before
sorting this column, you must tell the spreadsheet software that those
fields are dates with times and specify how they&rsquo;re formatted
(otherwise, the software might assume they&rsquo;re strings and sort them
alphabetically). Click column D to select all of the cells in that
column and then click <strong>Data</strong> ▸ <strong>Text to Columns</strong>. This
pops up a window that lets you define what type of data is in each
column. At the bottom of the window, click the DateEntered column and
choose <strong>Date (MDY)</strong> from the Column Type drop-down, because the dates
in this data are formatted with month, then date, then year. Click
<strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>Now that the spreadsheet software knows the correct format for the
DateEntered cells, you can sort it by this column. Click the DateEntered
header cell to select it (make sure not to select the whole column, just
the header cell) and then click <strong>Data</strong> ▸ <strong>Sort
Descending</strong>. This should reorder all of the rows so that the row with
the most recent DateEntered is at the top and the one with oldest is at
the bottom. In <em>Documents.csv</em>, the most recent documents are from June
6, 2020, during the Black Lives Matter protests. Some of the most recent
document titles include &ldquo;Special Bulletin Planned Protests 060620 1800
UPDATE,&rdquo; &ldquo;ANTIFA Sub Groups and Indicators &ndash; LES,&rdquo; and &ldquo;ANTIFA -
Fighting in the Streets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I often use graphical spreadsheet programs to search CSVs. In
LibreOffice, as well as in other spreadsheet programs, you can find
specific cells using the Find feature. Press
<strong>CTRL</strong>-F (or, in macOS,
[<code>&lt;?ace 1a ?&gt;</code>-F), enter your search term, and
press }]{.code_symbol-alt<strong>ENTER</strong>. This should search every cell in the spreadsheet
for your term. You can use this method to find a row containing, for
example, a specific ID number or email address.</p>
<p>When you close the spreadsheet, don&rsquo;t save your changes. It&rsquo;s good
practice to avoid changing original documents in a dataset. If you want
to keep a record of your changes, save the file as a copy in either the
ODF Spreadsheet (<em>.ods</em>) or Excel (<em>.xlsx</em>) format.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at the same CSV in a text editor instead of spreadsheet
software. Here are the first few lines of the <em>Documents.csv</em> file, as
viewed in a text editor like VS Code:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>DocumentID,DocFilename,Author,DateEntered,SortOrder,DocTitle,Description,ShortDescription,

,,&quot;DPI00000\086.png&quot;,0,0,
--snip--
</code></pre></div>

<p>Because text editors show you only the text when you view a CSV file,
without lining up the columns like spreadsheet software does, it&rsquo;s less
clear which value matches to which header for each row. There&rsquo;s no
simple way to manipulate the data, either&mdash;you can&rsquo;t sort it by
DateEntered like you can in LibreOffice Calc or Microsoft Excel.
However, it&rsquo;s simple to write code that loads the data from CSVs into
dictionaries, allowing you to manipulate it in any way you choose, as
you&rsquo;ll do later in this chapter.</p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;re familiar with the structure of CSVs, you&rsquo;re ready to see
how I began my investigation into the BlueLeaks dataset.</p>
<h3>My BlueLeaks Investigation</h3>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even realize that my local police intelligence agency, the
Northern California Regional Intelligence Center (NCRIC, pronounced
&ldquo;nick-rick&rdquo;), existed until I discovered it in the BlueLeaks dataset in
June 2020. In this section I describe how I went about my investigation
into BlueLeaks, what I discovered in the NCRIC portion of the dataset,
and a specific revelation I found in one of the NCRIC CSV files.</p>
<h4>Focusing on a Fusion Center</h4>
<p>After downloading BlueLeaks, I indexed it in The Intercept&rsquo;s Intella
server to make it easier to search. This allowed me and journalists I
worked with to quickly search it for keywords and find interesting
documents. However, I could tell that searching for keywords would only
get me so far. There was so much data that if I
only searched terms like <em>Black Lives Matter</em>, I was bound to miss a lot
of it. Moreover, the searches I did make often led me to CSVs, which
would take more work to untangle.</p>
<p>BlueLeaks was split into hundreds of folders, each one belonging to a
different law enforcement organization. Since almost all of these
organizations were unfamiliar to me, though, I couldn&rsquo;t tell from the
names which folder belonged to which organization. I started my own
spreadsheet to keep track of this, manually adding rows for each folder
as I matched organizations and their websites to it. Eventually, I
realized that I could automate this with a Python script.</p>
<p>I also used shell scripting to figure out which folders had the most
data, because I guessed they were the largest or most active fusion
centers. I quickly discovered that the <em>ncric</em> folder, one of the
largest in the dataset, held documents for NCRIC, so that&rsquo;s where I
decided to focus my digging.</p>
<h4>Introducing NCRIC</h4>
<p>NCRIC, based in San Francisco, shares information between federal
agencies, local police departments across Northern California, and
private industry partners, including tech companies. As I discovered by
combing through the CSVs in this dataset, it also provides services to
local cops, like monitoring social media or helping break into locked
smartphones, and it hosts events and classes for law enforcement
officers.</p>
<p>Using a custom tool I developed called BlueLeaks Explorer, which I&rsquo;ll
discuss in detail in Chapter 10, I examined
everything I could find in the <em>ncric</em> folder dated within the 13 days
between George Floyd&rsquo;s murder and when NCRIC was hacked. I discovered
that twice a day, NCRIC emailed over 14,000 cops an updated list of
Black Lives Matter protests. Local police and other partners could also
log in to NCRIC&rsquo;s website and submit suspicious activity reports (SARs)
to distribute to the fusion center&rsquo;s partners. Local police also
requested NCRIC&rsquo;s help with monitoring the social media accounts of
protest organizers and, in two instances, with identifying threats
against white female teenagers who were facing harassment after making
racist statements and using anti-Black slurs.</p>
<h4>Investigating a SAR</h4>
<p>By investigating a row from a CSV file, I found a PDF of a scanned
letter that turned out to be newsworthy. The letter, written by an
unhinged San Francisco&ndash;area lawyer to a local district attorney&rsquo;s
office, called a polite student from Oregon an &ldquo;antifa terrorist.&rdquo; In
this section, I describe how I found this revelation in BlueLeaks, what
it contains, and how the BlueLeaks CSVs reference other documents in the
dataset.</p>
<p>When I grepped the CSV files in the <em>ncric</em> folder for the word
<em>antifa</em>, I found that there were only a handful of references in the
files <em>EmailBuilder .csv</em>, <em>Requests.csv</em>, <em>SARs.csv</em>, and <em>Survey.csv</em>.
In particular, this row in <em>SARs.csv</em> stood out because it referenced a
student protester, allegedly a member of an antifa group, and mentioned
&ldquo;Radicalization/Extremism&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>micah@trapdoor ncric % grep -ri antifa *.csv
--snip--
SARs.csv:14277,&quot;06/05/20 14:20:09&quot;,&quot;6/5/2020&quot;,&quot;Marin&quot;,&quot;The attached letter was received via US Postal Service this morning. The letter was passed on from an anonymous party claiming to be a lawyer who was contacted by [redacted name] who is a University of Oregon student. [Redacted name] appears to be a member of the Antifa group and is assisting in planning protesting efforts in the Bay Area despite living in Oregon.&quot;,&quot;[redacted IP address]&quot;,,&quot;NCRICLawEnforceme ntReporting&quot;,,&quot;Unknown&quot;,,&quot;[redacted phone number]&quot;,&quot;f14e1d15-a052-489c-968b-5fd9d38544e1&quot;, &quot;20200596&quot;,&quot;0820&quot;,,&quot;Bay Area&quot;,,0,,0,0,0,,0,0,,,0,0,0,0,,,,,&quot;[redacted name]&quot;,,,,0,,,,,,,&quot; [redacted name]&quot;,&quot;[redacted name]&quot;,&quot;[redacted name]&quot;,,,&quot;Marin County District Attorney&#39;s Office&quot;,,,,,&quot;SARF100014\277.pdf&quot;,,,,,&quot;- Other -”,,,,,,”Letter.pdf”,,,,,,,”[redacted]@marincounty.org&quot;,&quot;AM&quot;,&quot;1&quot;,,,,,,0,0,&quot;Radicalization/Extremism,Suspicious Incident&quot;,,&quot;Emergency Services,Government Facility&quot;,,,&quot;No&quot;
--snip--
</code></pre></div>

<p>Looking into the <em>SARs.csv</em> file, I found that it lists one month of
SARs submitted to NCRIC. The earliest report was May 6, 2020, and the
latest was June 6, 2020, so my guess is that NCRIC retains SARs only for
a month.</p>
<p>Try opening this file, <em>ncric/SARs.csv</em>, in your spreadsheet software,
and you&rsquo;ll see that it&rsquo;s difficult to parse. There are 91 different
columns, and some of the cells are filled with so much text that even
with a large monitor, you can see only part of a row at a time. To make
it easier to read, I copied the content of the BriefSummary cell from
the spreadsheet and pasted it into my text editor, something that I
frequently needed to do with the CSVs in this dataset before I developed
BlueLeaks Explorer. Here are the relevant fields from the row that
caught my eye:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SARSid</strong> 14277</p>
<p><strong>FormTimeStamp</strong> 06/05/20 14:20:09</p>

<p><strong>BriefSummary</strong> The attached letter was received via US Postal Service
this morning. The letter was passed on from an anonymous party claiming
to be a lawyer who was contacted by <em>[redacted name]</em> who is a
University of Oregon student. <em>[Redacted name]</em> appears to be a member
of the Antifa group and is assisting in planning protesting efforts in
the Bay Area despite living in Oregon.</p>
<p><strong>Subjects</strong> <em>[redacted name]</em></p>

<p><strong>File1Name</strong> Letter.pdf</p>
<p><strong>EmailAddress</strong> <em>[redacted]</em>\@marincounty.org</p>
<p><strong>PhoneNumber</strong> <em>[redacted phone number]</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The SAR listed the full name, email address, and phone number of the
person who had submitted it. I looked them up online and discovered
that they worked as an investigator for the
district attorney&rsquo;s office in Marin County (just north of San
Francisco). On June 5 at 2:20 PM (per the FormTimestamp
field), the day before NCRIC was hacked, they logged in to the NCRIC
website and submitted the SAR form. They included a PDF called
<em>Letter.pdf</em> (per the File1Name field), though the website saved it in
the <em>SARF100014</em> folder as <em>277.pdf</em> (per the File1 field).</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>The server that hosted NCRIC&rsquo;s website and all of the other BlueLeaks
sites was running Windows, which is why folders in paths are separated
by backslashes (\), like <code>SARF100014\277.pdf</code>, instead
of forward slashes (<code>/</code>).</em></p>
<p>Each BlueLeaks folder has a subfolder called <em>files</em>, where you can find
the files referenced in the CSV. See if you can find the PDF referenced
in the File1 field in the <em>ncric</em> folder. It should be at the path
<em>ncric/files/SARF100014/277.pdf</em> (see Figure
9-3).</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 9-3: A PDF attachment in the SAR submitted by an investigator from the Marin County DA’s office" src="media/images/Figure9-3.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 9-3: A PDF attachment in the SAR submitted by an investigator from the Marin County DA’s office</em></p>
<p>The PDF shows a letter in all caps mailed to the Marin County DA&rsquo;s
office by a Bay Area attorney: &ldquo;PLEASE SEE THE ATTACHED SOLICITATION I
RECEIVED FROM AN ANTIFA TERRORIST WANTING MY HELP TO BAIL HER AND HER
FRIENDS OUT OF JAIL, IF ARRESTED FOR RIOTING.&rdquo; He explained that he was
remaining anonymous because he &ldquo;CANNOT
RISK THIS PIECE OF SHIT ANTIFA [&hellip;] FILING A BAR COMPLAINT AGAINST
ME,&rdquo; and warned that &ldquo;THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDERS WILL VIGOROUSLY
DEFEND THESE TERRORISTS.&rdquo; He ended his letter, &ldquo;HAPPY HUNTING.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further down in the PDF, the attorney included the solicitation from the
&ldquo;antifa terrorist,&rdquo; shown in Figure 9-4.</p>

<em>Figure 9-4: The letter that the Oregon student sent to the California lawyer</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a long time activist and ally of the Black Lives Matter movement,&rdquo;
the Oregon student wrote. &ldquo;&hellip; Is there anyway [<em>sic</em>] that I could
add your firm, or consenting lawyers under your firm, to a list of
resources who will represent protesters pro bono if they were/are to be
arrested? Thank you very much for your time.&rdquo; The Marin County DA
investigator apparently believed that this was useful enough
intelligence that they logged in to their account on NCRIC&rsquo;s website and
submitted it as &ldquo;suspicious activity&rdquo; for other law enforcement officers
around Northern California to access. Under threat activity, they chose
Radicalization/Extremism.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>You can read more about my findings from this SAR in the first article
I wrote about BlueLeaks, at <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/07/15/blueleaks-anonymous-ddos-law-enforcement-hack/">https://theintercept.com/2020/07/15/blueleaks-anonymous-ddos-law-enforcement-hack/</a>.

<p>In theory, I could have stumbled upon the PDF
in Figure 9-3 on its own; I might have just
randomly clicked through documents and happened to open
<em>ncric/files/SARF100014/277.pdf</em>, the path to the PDF in question. I
could also have indexed the <em>ncric</em> folder in Aleph, OCRing all of the
documents, and searched for <em>antifa</em>. However, the PDF alone doesn&rsquo;t
explain who uploaded it to the NCRIC website, when and why they uploaded
it, and how they described the document. Moreover, if you&rsquo;re interested
in focusing on activity in the fusion center from a specific time
period, it&rsquo;s easier to find which documents are relevant by their
timestamps in the CSV files. If you&rsquo;re researching BlueLeaks yourself,
you can quickly find all of the documents associated with a time period
by sorting the spreadsheets by date, reading all the rows in the CSVs
for that time period, and looking at the documents that those rows
reference.</p>
<p>Whenever you find an interesting document in BlueLeaks, search the CSVs
for its filename to figure out why that document is there to begin with.
It could be an attachment in a SAR, part of a bulk-email message the
fusion center sent to thousands of local police, or included for other
reasons. In the case of <em>277.pdf</em>, now you know this document was
uploaded as an attachment to a SAR by an investigator in a DA&rsquo;s office.
The CSV provides the investigator&rsquo;s summary of the document&rsquo;s contents,
along with their contact information, which you can use to reach out to
them for comment before publishing your findings.</p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve seen the type of data <em>SARs.csv</em> contains, you need a
way to easily read the long blocks of text in those CSV cells without
having to copy and paste them into a text editor. We&rsquo;ll cover that in
Exercise 9-1, but first, let&rsquo;s have a quick tutorial on how to write
code that works with CSV files.</p>
<h3>Reading and Writing CSV Files in Python</h3>
<p>As you learned in Chapter 8, Python modules
bring extra functionality into the script that you&rsquo;re writing. It&rsquo;s easy
to load CSVs and turn each row into a Python dictionary using Python&rsquo;s
built-in <code>csv</code> module. You&rsquo;ll
need <code>csv</code> for this chapter&rsquo;s
exercises, so import it using the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">csv</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>After importing it, you can take advantage of its functionality. The
<code>csv</code> features I use the most
are <code>csv.DictReader()</code>, which
lets you parse rows of a CSV as dictionaries, and
<code>csv.DictWriter()</code>, which lets
you save your own CSVs from data stored in dictionaries.</p>
<p>The following code loads a CSV file and loops through its rows by using
<code>csv.DictReader()</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">csv_path</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">reader</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">csv</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">DictReader</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">row</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">reader</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">row</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This code assumes the path to the CSV filename
is in the <code>csv_path</code> variable,
which could be a string that you hardcoded or a CLI argument you passed
into your program. After opening the CSV file with
<code>open(csv _path)</code> and storing
the file objects as <code>f</code>, the
code defines a new variable called <code>reader</code> and sets its value to
<code>csv.DictReader(f)</code>, which
prepares you to read rows from this CSV. The <code>reader</code> object acts a little like a list of
dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row. Although it&rsquo;s not
actually a list, you can use a <code>for</code> loop to loop through it as if it were.
Inside the <code>for</code> loop,
<code>row</code> is a dictionary that
represents the data in a row from the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>The process of saving new CSVs is similar to loading them, except you
use <code>csv.DictWriter()</code>. For
example, the following code uses Python to save the
<em>city-populations.csv</em> file discussed in the Introducing the CSV File
Format section earlier in this chapter:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">headers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;City&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Country&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Population&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>This code first defines the headers of the spreadsheet in the list
<code>headers</code>, then opens the
output file (<code>csv_path</code>) for
writing. Creating a <code>csv.DictWriter()</code> object allows you to save data into
the CSV. You must pass the headers in as a keyword argument called
<code>fieldnames</code>. You must also
run <code>writer .writeheader()</code>,
which saves the header row to the CSV file, before writing any of the
data rows.</p>
<p>You can then add rows to the spreadsheet by running
<code>writer.writerow()</code>, passing
in a dictionary whose keys match your headers. For example, the first
call of <code>writer.writerow()</code>
passes in the dictionary
<code>{"City": "Tōkyō", "Country": "Japan", "Population": 37400000}</code>. The keys for this dictionary are the
same as the headers for the CSV: <code>City</code>, <code>Country</code>, and <code>Population</code>.</p>
<p>In the following exercises, you&rsquo;ll use your new CSV programming skills
to write scripts that make the data hidden in BlueLeaks CSVs easier to
read and understand.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>To learn more about the <code>csv</code> module, you can find the full documentation, including plenty of example code, at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html">https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html</a>.</em></p>
<h3>Exercise 9-1: Make BlueLeaks CSVs More Readable</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s easier to read <em>SARs.csv</em> in a spreadsheet program than in a
text editor, it&rsquo;s still quite difficult. As mentioned earlier, there are
91 columns (though most of their values are blank), and some of the text
fields, like BriefSummary, contain way too much text to see at one time
in a spreadsheet cell. In this exercise, you&rsquo;ll write a script that
makes <em>SARs.csv</em> (or any CSV with similar content) easier to read by
showing you the data a single row at a time.</p>
<p>This exercise is designed not just to show you how to work with the
<em>SARs.csv</em> file, but to give you practice looping through the rows and
fields in a CSV. These skills will come in handy whenever you write code
that reads data from CSVs.</p>
<p>For a challenge, you could try programming your own script to meet the
following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make this script accept an argument called <code>csv_path</code> using Click, which you first
    learned to use in Exercise 8-3.</li>
<li>Import the <code>csv</code> module
    and loop through all of the rows in the CSV located at
    <code>csv_path</code>, loading each
    row as a dictionary, as discussed in the previous section.</li>
<li>For each row, display all of the <em>non-empty</em> values for its columns.
    If a value is empty, meaning it&rsquo;s an empty string (<code>""</code>), skip it. There&rsquo;s no reason to
    display all of the columns when so many of them have blank values.</li>
<li>Display each field on its own line. For example, one line could show
    <code>SARSid: 14277</code> and the
    next line could show <code>FormTimeStamp: 06/05/20 14:20:09</code>.</li>
<li>Output a separator line like <code>===</code> between each row so that you can
    tell rows apart.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, follow along with the rest of this exercise and I&rsquo;ll walk
you through the programming process. Start with the usual Python script
template in a file called <em>exercise-9-1.py</em>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">pass</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll modify your script to accept the <code>csv_path</code> argument.</p>
<h4>Accept the CSV Path as an Argument</h4>
<p>Instead of hardcoding the path to a specific CSV, let&rsquo;s use Click to
accept the path as an argument. Here&rsquo;s the code that does that (with
modifications shown in bold):</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">click</span>

<span class="nd">@click</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">command</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="nd">@click</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">argument</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;csv_path&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">csv_path</span><span class="p">):</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Make BlueLeaks CSVs easier to read&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="s2">&quot;CSV path: </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">csv_path</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Just like in Exercise 8-4, this code imports the <code>click</code> module, adds Click decorators before
the <code>main()</code> function to turn
it into a command that accepts the <code>csv_path</code> argument, and adds a docstring. For
now, it also displays the value of <code>csv_path</code> so you can test if the program works.
Run the code to test it as follows:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>micah@trapdoor chapter-9 % python3 exercise-9-1.py some-csv-path.csv
CSV path: some-csv-path.csv
</code></pre></div>

<p>The script just displays the CSV path that was passed in. So far, so
good.</p>
<h4>Loop Through the CSV Rows</h4>
<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll modify the code to open the CSV in <code>csv_path</code>, and, using the <code>csv</code> module, create a
<code>csv.DictReader()</code> object to
loop through the rows of that CSV:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">click</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">csv</span>

<span class="nd">@click</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">command</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="nd">@click</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">argument</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;csv_path&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">csv_path</span><span class="p">):</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Make BlueLeaks CSVs easier to read&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">csv_path</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;r&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">reader</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">csv</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">DictReader</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">row</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">reader</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">row</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
     <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This code now imports the <code>csv</code> module at the top. When the
<code>main()</code> function runs, the
code opens the file at <code>csv_path</code> for reading, creating a file object
variable called <code>f</code>. As noted
in Reading and Writing CSV Files in Python, you can use
<code>csv.DictReader()</code> to loop
through a CSV file, getting access to each row as a dictionary. The code
does this next, creating a variable called <code>reader</code> and setting it equal to
<code>csv.DictReader(f)</code>. Using
<code>reader</code>, the code then loops
through each row and displays the dictionary containing its data.</p>
<p>Test the code again, this time passing in the
path to <em>SARs.csv</em> as the CLI argument. Make sure you use the correct
path for your copy of the BlueLeaks dataset:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>micah@trapdoor chapter-9 % python3 exercise-9-1.py /Volumes/datasets/BlueLeaks-extracted/ncric/

--snip--
</code></pre></div>

<p>The output shows that during each loop, the <code>row</code> variable is a dictionary containing
the values for that row. So far, the code is simply displaying this
whole dictionary. This is a good start, but it still doesn&rsquo;t make the
text much easier to read. To do that, you&rsquo;ll display each field on its
own row.</p>
<h4>Display CSV Fields on Separate Lines</h4>
<p>The following modified code displays each row separately:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">click</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Rather than just displaying the <code>row</code> dictionary, this code loops through
all of its keys, storing each in the variable <code>key</code>. Since <code>key</code> is the key to the dictionary
<code>row</code>, you can look up its
value by using <code>row[key]</code>. You
only want to display fields that aren&rsquo;t
blank, so after making sure that this key doesn&rsquo;t have a blank value,
the code displays both it and the value. Finally, after it has finished
looping through all of the keys in each row, the code displays the
separator <code>===</code> between the
rows.</p>

Good afternoon,

CA police made contact with the Subject&#39;s mother who reported she has not had contact with him
in quite some time and last knew him to be in the Bay area, likely off his medication.  She
reported he suffers from bi-polar disorder.

<p>This time, the output should display <code>===</code> between the rows and display each
field of a row on its own line. If there are any blank fields, the
program skips them.</p>
<p>Using the command line skills you learned in
Chapters 3 and
4, redirect the output into a file with the
following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>python3<span class="w"> </span>exercise-9-1.py<span class="w"> </span>/Volumes/datasets/BlueLeaks-extracted/ncric/SARs.csv<span class="w"> </span>&gt;<span class="w"> </span>SARs.txt
</code></pre></div>

<p>This should run your script again, this time saving the output into
<em>SARs.txt</em> instead of displaying it in your terminal. Now you can easily
scroll through the saved output in a text editor like VS Code and search
it for keywords to learn about the &ldquo;suspicious activity&rdquo; that occurred
in Northern California from May 6 to June 6, 2020.</p>
<p>Next we&rsquo;ll move on from SARs to explore another important spreadsheet in
NCRIC: <em>EmailBuilder.csv</em>.</p>
<h3>How to Read Bulk Email from Fusion Centers</h3>
<p>The primary purpose of fusion centers is to share information between
local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies. They do this,
essentially, by sending bulk email to a large list of local police
officers. You can find the content of this email for all sites in
BlueLeaks, including NCRIC, in the <em>EmailBuilder.csv</em> file located in
each site&rsquo;s folder. These files include the content of all of the
bulk-email messages each fusion center sent until June 6, 2020, when it
was hacked.</p>
<p>Some of these messages are security bulletins from federal agencies like
the FBI or the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Others contain
content directly created by the fusion center&mdash;for example, NCRIC and
other fusion centers around the US generated detailed daily lists of
protests against police brutality during the summer of 2020. For the 13
days of NCRIC data that I looked at in detail, over half of the bulk
email contained information about largely peaceful protests.</p>
<p>The SARs spreadsheet contains plaintext data, so it&rsquo;s easy to read in a
text editor. But the bulk-email spreadsheet contains data in HyperText
Markup Language (HTML) format, making it difficult to read unless you
use a web browser. In this section, you&rsquo;ll learn to more easily read the
HTML content of NCRIC&rsquo;s bulk email, find the recipients of each email,
and find the documents attached to the email messages. Open
<em>ncric/EmailBuilder.csv</em> in your spreadsheet software to follow along.</p>
<h4>Lists of Black Lives Matter Demonstrations</h4>
<p>Most of the intelligence on Black Lives Matter protests flowed through
NCRIC&rsquo;s Terrorism Liaison Officer (TLO) program, whose purpose is to
keep the intelligence center&rsquo;s members &ldquo;engaged &amp; knowledgeable about
current terrorist tactics, techniques &amp; trends, regional crime trends &amp;
threats, and Officer safety information,&rdquo; according to the TLO page on
NCRIC&rsquo;s website. During the summer of 2020, this counterterrorism
program didn&rsquo;t focus on terrorism so much as upcoming racial justice
protests.</p>
<p>This section describes the twice-daily lists of
upcoming protests that TLO sent to thousands of local cops. Not only is
this incredibly newsworthy&mdash;a counterterrorism program abused to
monitor racial justice protests&mdash;but these were the most common
bulk-email messages that NCRIC sent during the 13-day period I examined.</p>
<p>For example, here are the most interesting fields from the most recent
row in <em>ncric/EmailBuilder.csv</em> (this CSV has 81 columns in total, most
of which didn&rsquo;t contain any relevant information):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>EmailBuilderID</strong> 6170</p>
<p><strong>EmailFrom</strong> NCRIC &lt;info@ncric.net&gt;</p>
<p><strong>EmailSubject</strong> NCRIC TLO Bulletin LES</p>
<p><strong>EmailBody</strong> &lt;base href=&rdquo;https://ncric.ca.gov/&rdquo;&gt;&lt;div style=&rdquo;font-family: times; text-align: center;&rdquo;&gt;&lt;font face=&rdquo;Calibri, Times&rdquo;&gt;UNCLASSIFIED//&lt;font color=&rdquo;#ee0000&rdquo;&gt;LAW ENFORCEMENT SENSITIVE&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;[&hellip;]</p>
<p><strong>Attachment1</strong> EBAT1\Events_060620_1800.pdf</p>
<p><strong>DateSent</strong> 06/06/20 20:25:06</p>
<p><strong>EmailTable</strong> Registrations</p>
<p><strong>SentEmailList</strong> EBSE00006\170.csv</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This row tells us that on the evening of June 6, 2020, NCRIC sent an
email with the subject line &ldquo;NCRIC TLO Bulletin LES&rdquo; to the list of
people described in <em>EBSE00006\170.csv</em> (LES stands for Law Enforcement
Sensitive). The email included the PDF attachment located at
<em>EBAT1\Events_060620_1800.pdf</em>.</p>
<p>The body of the email is the HTML in the EmailBody column. HTML is the
markup language that describes web pages, so it can be hard to make
sense of when you&rsquo;re not viewing it in a web browser. To read this email
body, in your text editor, create a new file called
<em>EmailBuilder-6170.html</em> (since 6170 is the EmailBuilderID). Copy the
content of the EmailBody field from your spreadsheet software for this
row, paste it into this file, and save it. You can now open this file in
a web browser to view it, but before you do that, you may want to read
the Covering Your Tracks with a VPN Service box to consider
mitigating what information you might leak by opening it.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5>COVERING YOUR TRACKS WITH A VPN SERVICE</h5>
<p>The BlueLeaks CSV files are full of HTML code, such as the EmailBody field in the <code>EmailBuilder.csv</code> files. Many of these blocks of HTML include embedded images. If you read through the HTML code in the EmailBody cell in the preceding example, you’ll see that it loads an image hosted on NCRIC’s server at the URL https://ncric.org/html/Picture2.jpg?135653. Viewing HTML from BlueLeaks in a web browser makes it much easier to read and understand compared to trying to read the HTML code directly, but it will also cause your computer to make an internet request to the law enforcement servers themselves. These servers will most likely log your IP address, leaving clues that you’re investigating them.</p>
<p>For the BlueLeaks dataset, it doesn’t matter much if the fusion center servers track your IP address. It’s not illegal to load images off of law enforcement websites. For more sensitive datasets, however, it’s prudent to hide your IP address from organizations you’re investigating. You can load these images while hiding your real IP address by connecting to a <em>virtual private network (VPN) service</em>, which reroutes your internet traffic through its own server, then forwards your traffic to those websites. This leaves the VPN server’s IP address, rather than your own, in the websites’ web logs.</p>
<p>For example, say you load the <em>EmailBuilder-6170.html</em> file in your web browser from your home in San Francisco. If you load images hosted on https://ncric.org, a San Francisco IP address from a residential neighborhood will show up in the website’s logs. The site might be able to determine that this IP address belongs to you by sending a data request to your internet service provider, for example. If you first connect to a VPN, however—one in New York, let’s say—then they’ll see a New York IP address from a data center in their logs instead. They’ll still know that someone loaded the image, but it won’t be immediately obvious that <em>you</em> loaded the image. Everyone using that VPN service shares its IP address, making it harder to track down individual users.</p>
<p>While VPNs may make you anonymous from the websites you’re visiting, they don’t make you anonymous from the VPN provider itself. Use a trustworthy VPN provider that you believe isn’t logging your traffic and selling it. Additionally, contrary to popular opinion, commercial VPN services don’t prevent websites from tracking your browsing habits; that’s mostly done using a technology called cookies. In other words, VPNs don’t stop the Googles and Facebooks of the world from following you around the web.</p>
<p><em>Consumer Reports</em> publishes in-depth reviews of different VPN services, comparing them on overall privacy and security, whether they’ve had public security audits, whether they’re open source, and whether they include misleading marketing. VPN services normally cost a few dollars a month. For the most part, I recommend avoiding free VPNs; they’re nearly all scams set up to spy on their users and sell their data, or even to inject advertisements into web pages users visit. The only exception I know of are VPNs powered by the open source software Bitmask, like the one run by the Seattle-based tech collective Riseup. You can learn more about Bitmask from <a href="https://bitmask.net">https://bitmask.net</a>, and you can learn about Riseup’s free VPN service at <a href="https://riseup.net/en/vpn">https://riseup.net/en/vpn</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether or not you&rsquo;ve connected to a VPN
service (the choice is yours), open <em>EmailBuilder-6170.html</em> using a web
browser by double-clicking on it in your file manager. Figure 9-5 shows what it looks like in a web browser.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 9-5: HTML from the EmailBody field in a row of EmailBuilder.csv, viewed in a web browser" src="media/images/Figure9-5.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 9-5: HTML from the EmailBody field in a row of EmailBuilder.csv, viewed in a web browser`</em></p>
<p>As you can see from the screenshot, this email body is a template, not
the email itself. The HTML files stored inside CSVs for BlueLeaks sites
are all templates. When sending the email, the NCRIC site would replace
[AttachmentLinks] with the actual links to the email attachments as
well as replacing other placeholders in the template. The attachments
themselves are listed as fields in the CSV.</p>
<p>This email contained one attachment, as noted in the Attachment1 field
of the most recent row in <em>EmailBuilder.csv</em>: the PDF file
<em>EBAT1\Events_060620_1800.pdf</em>. Figure 9-6
shows the first page of that document.</p>
<p>The NCRIC Terrorism Liaison Officer program distributed this list to
local police across Northern California. The events included Novato
Peaceful Car Caravan, Taking a Knee for Change, and the Noe Valley
Police Violence Protest with Social Distancing (the protests took place
during the COVID-19 pandemic, after all).</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 9-6: A list of upcoming Black Lives Matter protests in the file Events_060620_1800.pdf" src="media/images/Figure9-6.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 9-6: A list of upcoming Black Lives Matter protests in the file Events_060620_1800.pdf</em></p>
<p>You can use the SentEmailList and EmailTable values to discover how
many, and exactly which, local police officers received these daily
bulletins. The value of SentEmailList is the path to a CSV file itself:
<em>EBSE00006\170.csv</em>. When you open that CSV file (it&rsquo;s in
<em>ncric/files</em>), you can see that it has 14,459 rows (one of which is the
header) and looks like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>IDs,Registrations
63861
63862
63929
63930
--snip--
</code></pre></div>

<p>In short, this CSV contains a huge list of ID numbers. The value of
EmailTable in the <em>EmailBuilder.csv</em> row is <code>Registrations</code>, which is a good hint. Since I knew
that these IDs must match up to rows in some other table, I decided to
check the file <em>Registrations.csv</em>.</p>
<p>Open that spreadsheet yourself at <em>ncric/Registrations.csv</em>. It has 185
columns and over 29,000 rows, apparently listing everyone who had an
account on NCRIC&rsquo;s website. It includes each user&rsquo;s full name; the
agency they work for and whether it&rsquo;s local, state, federal, or
military; their email address, physical address, and cell phone number;
their supervisor&rsquo;s name and contact information; their password hash;
and other details.</p>
<p>The first column of <em>Registrations.csv</em> is
called RegistrationsID. Each ID in the <em>EBSE00006\170.csv</em> file can be
cross-referenced with one of these registrations. For example, the
person in <em>Registrations.csv</em> with the RegistrationsID 63861 works at
the Santa Clara County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, lives in San Jose, has an email
address at the domain pro.sccgov.org, and has a phone number with a 408
area code. In other words, NCRIC sent the email to this list of 14,458
contacts, whose contact details can be found in the <em>Registrations.csv</em>
file. The BlueLeaks dataset includes this information about everyone who
received bulk email through any of the websites. In Exercise 9-3, when
you read through bulk email found in BlueLeaks, you&rsquo;ll be able to look
up exactly who received these email messages.</p>
<h4>“Intelligence” Memos from the FBI and DHS</h4>
<p>As mentioned earlier, in addition to detailed lists of upcoming
protests, NCRIC also frequently forwarded memos from its federal
partners&mdash;agencies like the FBI and DHS&mdash;to its list of over 14,000
local cops. These memos largely contained internet rumors, hoaxes that
had already been debunked but that federal agencies apparently fell for,
and warnings about violence from protesters that didn&rsquo;t materialize.</p>
<p>For example, in the row in <em>EmailBuilder.csv</em> with the EmailBuilderID of
6169, the email body says, &ldquo;The NCRIC is disseminating this (U//LES)
Update on behalf of the FBI.&rdquo; The Attachment1 value in that row is
<em>EBAT1\SITREP-6-JUN-1300_OPE.pdf</em>, an unclassified FBI document dated
June 6, 2020. The document is full of cherry-picked quotes from social
media posts threatening violence, but without any context. There was no
way of knowing how many followers an account had, how much engagement
their post had, or even if they were parodies.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Social Media Exploitation (SOMEX)&rdquo; section of this FBI document
describes people using Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram to post &ldquo;flyers
seeking to hire &lsquo;professional anarchists.&rsquo; &rdquo; This appears to reference
an internet hoax from late May 2020. In fact, I found multiple articles
debunking this hoax on fact-checking sites, including Snopes,
PolitiFact, and <em>Reuters</em>, dated a week before the FBI distributed this
memo. The fake recruitment flyer offers to compensate &ldquo;professional
anarchists&rdquo; with \$200 per direct action, and includes the text &ldquo;Funded
by George Soros.&rdquo; (Antisemitic right-wing Americans frequently and
falsely claim that Soros, a Jewish billionaire, funds left-wing
protesters.) The flyer also included the phone number for a local branch
of the Democratic Party. Both this local Democratic Party branch and
Soros&rsquo;s Open Society Foundations confirmed that the flyer was a fake,
but this didn&rsquo;t stop the FBI from distributing it to NCRIC, which
disseminated it to 14,458 local police across Northern California.</p>
<p>The DHS also sent several memos to NCRIC to distribute to the center&rsquo;s
list. For example, take a look at the row in <em>EmailBuilder.csv</em> with the
EmailBuilderID of 6144. The email body says, &ldquo;The NCRIC is disseminating
the Intelligence Note &lsquo;(U//FOUO) Some Violent Opportunists Probably
Engaging in Organized Activities&rsquo; on behalf of DHS,&rdquo; and the attached
document is <em>EBAT1\(U&mdash;FOUO) IN - Some
Violent Opportunists Probably Engaging in Organized Activities
06012020.pdf</em>.</p>
<p>The attached PDF declares, &ldquo;As the protests persist, we assess that the
organized violent opportunists&mdash;including suspected anarchist
extremists&mdash;could increasingly perpetrate nationwide targeting of law
enforcement and critical infrastructure.&rdquo; (This didn&rsquo;t happen.) The memo
goes on to say that an NYPD official &ldquo;had strong evidence that suspected
anarchist groups had planned to incite violence at protests, including
by using encrypted communications.&rdquo; Incidentally, if you completed
Exercise 2-2 and installed Signal, you too are now a user of encrypted
communications.</p>
<p>As noted in Chapter 1, it&rsquo;s important to
reach out to the people you&rsquo;re investigating to get their side of the
story. Mike Sena, NCRIC&rsquo;s executive director, told me that his
intelligence agency was monitoring Black Lives Matters protests in order
to make sure that they remained safe. &ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t keeping track of the
protests themselves, but we were identifying where we were gonna have
gatherings of people,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s our concern; we want to make
sure the events are safe&mdash;and if there are any threats that come up
that may be associated with any of those events that we&rsquo;re able to get
that threat data to whatever agency may have protection
responsibilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also good practice to contact outside experts&mdash;those who know more
about the subject matter than you do&mdash;for comment. Vasudha Talla, a
senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of
Northern California, told me, &ldquo;Really what we have here is overbroad
collection and dissemination of people&rsquo;s protected First Amendment
activity, and it&rsquo;s untethered to any basis in the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As you can see, there are a lot of newsworthy details in
<em>EmailBuilder.csv</em>. However, it&rsquo;s still somewhat difficult to work with,
especially because of the HTML email bodies. Soon you&rsquo;ll write some code
to make all of the bulk email easier to read. To do that, first you will
need to learn the basics of HTML.</p>
<h3>A Brief HTML Primer</h3>
<p>In the following exercise, you&rsquo;ll write some Python code that in turn
writes some HTML code. This section covers just enough HTML syntax to
get you through this chapter.</p>
<p>HTML is made up of components called <em>tags</em>. For example, consider the
following HTML:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Hello world<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This code opens a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag
(which represents a paragraph), includes some content (the text
<code>Hello world</code>), and then
closes the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag with
<code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>. You open a tag with
<code>&lt;``tag-name``&gt;</code> and close it with <code>&lt;/``tag-name``&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>HTML typically includes tags inside of tags
inside of tags. It&rsquo;s common to indent HTML code for legibility, but
unlike in Python, indenting is completely optional. Here&rsquo;s an example of
a simple web page in HTML, indented to make it easier to read:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">html</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">head</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">title</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>My Super Cool Web Page<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">title</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">head</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">body</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Under Construction<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>This web page is under construction!<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">body</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">html</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The whole page is wrapped in the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag. Inside that, there&rsquo;s a
<code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag, which includes
metadata about the web page, and then a <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag, which includes the content of the
web page. The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag is
a metadata tag that describes the title of the web page, which is what&rsquo;s
displayed in the browser tab itself. Inside the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, the biggest heading is <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, followed by a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> paragraph.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other tags in HTML, but in the following exercise,
you&rsquo;ll use just two more: <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>. The <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> tag stands for &ldquo;unordered list,&rdquo; and
it&rsquo;s how you make bulleted lists in HTML. Inside the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> tag are <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tags, which stand for &ldquo;list item.&rdquo; For
example, here&rsquo;s some HTML for a simple bulleted list:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">ul</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Bash<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Python<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>HTML<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">ul</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>When displayed in a web browser, that HTML code would look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bash</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<p>The less-than and greater-than characters (<code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>) are used to open and close tags in
HTML. If you want to display literal less-than or greater-than
characters in HTML, you have to <em>HTML escape</em> them. This is similar to
escaping in shell scripts and Python code, but the syntax is different.
Escape <code>&lt;</code> by replacing it
with <code>&amp;lt;</code> and escape
<code>&gt;</code> by replacing it with
<code>&amp;gt;</code>. For example, here&rsquo;s
some HTML code that displays the text <code>I</code> <code>&lt;3 you</code> in a paragraph:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>I <span class="ni">&amp;lt;</span>3 you<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>There are a few other special characters in HTML that are each escaped
in their own way. For example, you&rsquo;d use <code>&amp;amp;</code> to escape an ampersand (<code>&amp;</code>).</p>
<p>In the next exercise, you&rsquo;ll make the email
messages in <em>EmailBuilder.csv</em> easier to read by writing a script that
automatically saves an HTML file for each one. This will also make it
much simpler for you to find the newsworthy ones.</p>
<h3>Exercise 9-2: Make Bulk Email Readable</h3>
<p>For this exercise, you&rsquo;ll write a script similar to the one you wrote in
Exercise 9-1, but instead of displaying text output to the screen,
you&rsquo;ll save HTML output to files. This allows you to look through a
folder full of HTML files, each one a different bulk email, open these
files in a web browser, and read them in a more legible format. While
this particular exercise is designed specifically for the
<em>EmailBuilder.csv</em> files in BlueLeaks, it&rsquo;s common to find HTML in
datasets, so being able to write a similar script could help you in the
future.</p>
<p>For a challenge, you can try programming your own script to meet the
following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make this script accept two arguments called<code>emailbuilder_csv_path</code> and <code>output_folder_path</code> using Click. The <code>emailbuilder_csv_path</code> argument should be the path to an <em>EmailBuilder.csv</em> file, and the <code>output_folder_path</code> argument should be the path to a folder in which to save the HTML files.</li>
<li>Make sure the folder at <code>output_folder_path</code> exists by importing the
    <code>os</code> module and running
    <code>os.makedirs(output_folder_path, exist_ok=True)</code>.</li>
<li>Import the <code>csv</code> module
    and loop through all of the rows in the CSV located at
    <code>emailbuilder_csv_path</code>,
    loading each row as a dictionary.</li>
<li>For each row, save a new HTML file. This file should include
    information from the bulk-email fields most relevant for your
    purposes: EmailBuilderID, EmailFrom, EmailSubject, DateSent,
    Attachment1, and SentEmailList. It should also include the HTML body
    of the email itself, EmailBody.</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, follow along with the rest of this exercise and I&rsquo;ll walk you
through the programming process. Start with the usual Python script
template in a file called <em>exercise-9-2.py</em>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">pass</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll modify your script to make the script accept command line
arguments using Click.</p>
<h4>Accept the Command Line Arguments</h4>
<p>The following code has been modified to import the <code>click</code> module and accept some command line
arguments:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">click</span>

<span class="nd">@click</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">command</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="nd">@click</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">argument</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;emailbuilder_csv_path&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nd">@click</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">argument</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;output_folder_path&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>First, the code imports the <code>click</code> module, and then it uses Click
decorators to make the <code>main()</code> function a Click command that accepts
two arguments, <code>emailbuilder_csv_path</code> and <code>output_folder_path</code>. The code also has two
<code>print()</code> statements that
display the values of the two arguments. The
<code>emailbuilder_csv_path</code>
argument should point to the path of a BlueLeaks <em>EmailBuilder.csv</em>,
which you&rsquo;ll load and loop through, and the
<code>output_folder _path</code> argument
should be the path to a folder in which you&rsquo;ll store the HTML files for
the bulk-email messages.</p>
<p>Test your code and make sure it&rsquo;s working as expected so far, replacing
the path to <em>EmailBuilder.csv</em> with the appropriate path for your
computer:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>micah@trapdoor chapter-9 % python3 exercise-9-2.py /Volumes/datasets/BlueLeaks-extracted/
ncric/EmailBuilder.csv output
Path to EmailBuilder.csv: /media/micah/datasets/BlueLeaks-extracted/ncric/EmailBuilder.csv
Output folder path: output
</code></pre></div>

<p>As expected, the script displays the values of the two arguments.</p>
<h4>Create the Output Folder</h4>
<p>Next, use Python to create the folder in <code>output_folder_path</code> where you&rsquo;ll save the HTML files:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">click</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os</span>

<span class="nd">@click</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">command</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="nd">@click</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">argument</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;emailbuilder_csv_path&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nd">@click</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">argument</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;output_folder_path&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">emailbuilder_csv_path</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">output_folder_path</span><span class="p">):</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Make bulk emails in BlueLeaks easier to read&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">makedirs</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">output_folder_path</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">exist_ok</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>To be able to use the <code>os.makedirs()</code> function, first the script imports the
<code>os</code> module. Then it uses the
<code>os.makedirs()</code> function to
create a new folder in Python, passing in the path to the folder to
create, <code>output_folder_path</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>exists_ok=True</code> keyword argument tells this function
that it&rsquo;s fine if that folder already exists; otherwise, if the folder
already existed, the script would crash with an error message. This way,
the first time you run this script with a specific output folder, it
will create that folder and use it to store the HTML files. If you run
the script again in the future with that same output folder, it will use
the folder that&rsquo;s already there.</p>
<p>When you run the complete script at the end of this exercise, you&rsquo;ll be
able to browse the files in this folder to read through the bulk-email
messages sent by a fusion center.</p>
<h4>Define the Filename for Each Row</h4>
<p>The goal of this script is to save an HTML file for each row in the
spreadsheet. To do this, you&rsquo;ll need to load the CSV, loop through its
rows, and figure out the filename for each HTML file that you&rsquo;re going
to save. Next, define the <code>filename</code> variable, naming each HTML file based
on data that you found in that row. To do so, make the following
modifications:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">click</span>

    <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The script starts by importing the <code>csv</code> module. As in the previous exercise,
the code then opens the CSV file and creates a CSV reader using
<code>csv.DictReader()</code>. Using a
<code>for</code> loop, the code loops
through each row in the CSV.</p>
<p>Rather than just displaying information, you ultimately want to save
each row as an HTML file. To prepare to write the code that actually
generates those files in the next section, this code defines a
<code>filename</code> variable with the
name of the unique HTML file to be generated for each row. In
order to make it unique, the code defines
<code>filename</code> using the current
row&rsquo;s EmailBuilderID, DateSent, and EmailSubject fields, and ends it
with the.<code>html</code> file
extension. For example, according to this format, the filename for the
bulk email described in the previous section would be <em>6170_06/06/20
20:25:06_NCRIC TLO Bulletin LES.html</em>.</p>
<p>The code defines <code>filename</code> as
an f-string surrounded in double quotes (<code>"</code>). The variables inside it, like
<code>row["EmailSubject"]</code>, have
quotes of their own, but you can&rsquo;t use the double-quote character inside
a double-quoted f-string without Python mistakenly thinking you&rsquo;re
closing the f-string. Instead, this code uses single quotes (<code>'</code>) for the variables within the
f-string: <code>row['EmailSubject']</code>.</p>
<p>The slash characters (<code>/</code>)
contained in the DateSent column are invalid characters for filenames
because slashes separate folders in a path. To address this, the line
<code>filename</code> <code>=</code> <code>filename.replace("/", "-")</code> replaces any slashes it finds in the
filename with dash characters (<code>-</code>). This generates the valid filename
<em>6170_06-06-20 20:25:06_NCRIC TLO Bulletin LES.html</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, this code uses <code>os.path.join()</code>, discussed in Chapter
8, to append <code>filename</code> to the end of
<code>output_folder_path</code>, giving
you the complete path to the file you&rsquo;re going to write. You&rsquo;ll
ultimately save the HTML file in this path. For example, if the filename
<code>output_folder_path</code> is
<code>output</code> and
<code>filename</code> is
<code>6170_06-06-20 20:25:06_NCRIC TLO Bulletin LES.html</code>, <code>os.path.join()</code> updates <code>filename</code> to be
<code>output/6170_06-06-20 20:25:06_NCRIC TLO Bulletin LES.html</code>.</p>
<p>To make sure everything is working so far, the code displays this final
filename. Pause and test your code, using the correct filepath for your
operating system:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>micah@trapdoor chapter-9 % python3 exercise-9-2.py /Volumes/datasets/BlueLeaks-extracted/

--snip--
</code></pre></div>

<p>The output should show a unique filename for each row in the
<em>EmailBuilder.csv</em> spreadsheet. All you need to do now is actually write
those HTML files.</p>
<h4>Write the HTML Version of Each Bulk Email</h4>
<p>The purpose of saving each row of <em>EmailBuilder.csv</em> as an HTML file is
to more easily read these bulk-email messages by loading the HTML in a
web browser. You&rsquo;ll obviously want to see the email body, but it would
also be helpful to display some basic metadata about the email: the date
it was sent, the subject, and so on. The following code writes the HTML
files, automatically filling in both the metadata and
the email body with data from the CSV:</p>

    <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>First, the code imports the <code>html</code> module, which will be used later on to
escape HTML code. The code starts by defining a list, called
<code>important_keys</code>, of all of
the important keys to include in the final HTML file. This code is
positioned near the top of the <code>main()</code> function, before the <code>for</code> loop, so that this variable will be
available inside each loop, and therefore every HTML file will include
these same fields.</p>
<p>Inside the <code>for</code> loop, the
code stores each row of the spreadsheet in the dictionary <code>row</code>, so you can access its fields using
keys. Then, the code opens the HTML file for writing with the command
<code>with open(filename, "w") as</code>
<code>html_f:</code> (as you saw in Reading and Writing
Files in Chapter 8). The file
object for the HTML file is the <code>html_f</code> variable. Inside this <code>with</code> statement, the code then starts
writing the HTML file by calling <code>html_f.write()</code> and passing in a string containing
HTML, first for <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags and then for a
<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> tag to represent a
bulleted list.</p>
<p>Next, the code fills in the bulleted list with the important metadata.
Using a <code>for</code> loop, it loops
through the keys in <code>important_keys</code>, writing each piece of metadata to the
HTML file in its own <code>&lt;li``&gt;</code> tag, in the format</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">strong</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>metadata_item:<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">strong</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> metadata_value<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>where <code>metadata_item</code>
is the name of an important piece of metadata in <code>key</code>, and <code>metadata_value</code> is the value of that piece of
metadata in <code>row[key]</code>. For
example, <code>metadata_item</code> might be
<code>EmailBuilderID</code>, and
<code>metadata_value</code>
might be <code>6170</code>, as in the
example CSV row in the Lists of Black Lives Matter
Demonstrations section.</p>
<p>Instead of displaying the value with <code>row[key]</code>, though, this line of code uses
<code>html.escape(row[key])</code>. This
is necessary because some of the fields you want to include use angle
brackets (<code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>), which indicate tags in HTML. For
example, if the value of the FromEmail field is <code>NCRIC</code> <code>&lt;info@ncric.net&gt;</code>, your web browser will interpret
<code>&lt;info@ncric.net&gt;</code> as an HTML
tag called <code>info@ncric.net</code>,
which isn&rsquo;t a real tag, so nothing will display. In Python, the
<code>html.escape()</code> function lets
you HTML escape a string. For example, <code>html.escape("NCRIC</code> <code>&lt;info@ncric.net&gt;")</code> returns the string
<code>NCRIC &amp;lt;info@ncric.net&amp;gt;</code>
and that&rsquo;s what gets saved to the HTML file, so that when you later view
that file, the string displays correctly as <code>NCRIC</code> <code>&lt;info@ncric.net&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>When the <code>for</code> loop finishes
running, all of the important metadata will have been written to the
HTML file. The code then writes <code>&lt;/ul&gt;</code> to close the bulleted list tag. After
displaying the bulleted list of important fields, the code displays the
EmailBody field in a <code>&lt;``div&gt;</code> tag. This time, it doesn&rsquo;t HTML escape
this field, because you want to load the email&rsquo;s HTML in a browser.
Finally, the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tags are closed with
<code>&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>This output looks similar to the last time you ran the script, except
now it also creates a folder full of 5,213 new HTML files&mdash;one for
every row of NCRIC&rsquo;s <em>EmailBuilder.csv</em> file&mdash;in the output folder you
specified. The information now included in
the filenames allows you to browse through the files in your file
manager, exploring those that look most interesting.</p>
<p>Figure 9-7 shows the list of files generated when I ran this script.</p>

<em>Figure 9-7: Viewing the HTML files generated by the Python script in macOS Finder</em></p>
<p>This folder contains the thousands of HTML files that your Python script
just created. The first part of the filename is the EmailBuilderID,
followed by DateSent, followed by EmailSubject. To read one of these
bulk emails, just double-click the HTML file to open it in a web
browser. If you want more information about a specific bulk email, you
can always look it up by EmailBuilderID in the original spreadsheet.</p>
<p>To see what the final HTML output looks like, open one of these files in
your text editor. For example, here&rsquo;s the final HTML output from the
<em>6098_05-18-20 12/45/12_Chasing Cell Phones presented via Zoom
Webinar.html</em> file:</p>

<p>All of the bolded parts have been filled in
automatically by the Python code. In the bulleted list at the top,
<code>EmailBuilderID</code>,
<code>EmailFrom</code>, and so on are
keys from the <code>important_keys</code>
list, and <code>6098</code>,
<code>NCRIC &amp;lt;info@ncric.net&amp;gt</code>,
and so on are HTML-escaped values from the <code>row</code> dictionary. Below the bulleted list,
inside the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag, is the
email body&mdash;the value of <code>row["EmailBody"]</code>.</p>
<p>Figure 9-8 shows what these bulk email
messages look like in a web browser. In this case, I opened a bulk email
sent out on May 18, 2020, advertising a course called Chasing Cell
Phones hosted by the Northern California High Intensity Drug Tracking
Area. The class was designed to teach police how to get valuable
evidence directly off of suspects&rsquo; cell phones or from third-party
sources like cell phone providers.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 9-8: Viewing a NCRIC bulk email in a web browser" src="media/images/Figure9-8.png" /><br />
<em>Figure 9-8: Viewing a NCRIC bulk email in a web browser</em></p>
<p>You can use the script from this exercise to make the bulk email from
any BlueLeaks folder more readable; just run the script on the
appropriate <em>EmailBuilder.csv</em> file.</p>
<p>The BlueLeaks folder names alone don&rsquo;t immediately make clear which
folders belong to which organizations. Let&rsquo;s fix that by creating a
spreadsheet that associates each BlueLeaks folder with its organization
name, website title, and URL.</p>
<h3>Discovering the Names and URLs of BlueLeaks Sites</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious what organization some BlueLeaks folders belong to based on
the folder name. You can reasonably guess that the <em>alabamafusioncenter</em>
folder has data from the Alabama Fusion Center. But most aren&rsquo;t so
clear. Can you guess what <em>ciacco</em> is? How about <em>nvhidta</em> or <em>snorca</em>?</p>
<p>After manually looking through the CSV files in various BlueLeaks
folders, I discovered that the file <em>Company.csv</em> contains, hidden among
its 108 columns, the name and URL of each site. Some BlueLeaks folders,
it turns out, host more than one site. For example, in Table
9-3, which shows these columns from NCRIC&rsquo;s
<em>Company.csv</em> file, you can see that the <em>ncric</em> folder hosts 18
different sites at different URLs.</p>

<p>As you can see here, the <em>ncric</em> folder hosts not only the NCRIC site
but also the sites for the Northern California High Intensity Drug
Trafficking Area (NCHIDTA); the Northern California Most Wanted, which
lists wanted fugitives; and others. However, all these websites share
the same code and databases.</p>
<p>Since almost every BlueLeaks folder contains a <em>Company.csv</em> file
listing all of the sites associated with that folder, we can write a
script to automatically extract this information and format it as a CSV
file. This will open the door for you to pick which fusion center you
want to research&mdash;perhaps there&rsquo;s one in a city near you.</p>
<h3>Exercise 9-3: Make a CSV of BlueLeaks Sites</h3>
<p>The script you write in this exercise will loop through each BlueLeaks
folder, open its <em>Company.csv</em> file, and save information about the
organizations whose websites are hosted in that folder into a CSV file
that you create. For a challenge, you can try programming your own
script to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accept two arguments: <code>blueleaks_path</code>, the path to your extracted
    BlueLeaks data, and <code>output_csv_path</code>, the path to the new CSV file that
    the script will create.</li>
<li>Include these headers: <code>BlueLeaksFolder</code> (the BlueLeaks folder name),
    <code>CompanyID</code>,
    <code>CompanyName</code>,
    <code>WebsiteTitle</code>, and
    <code>URL</code> (you&rsquo;ll find these
    latter fields in the various <em>Company.csv</em> files).</li>
<li>Open <code>output_csv_path</code> for
    writing and create a <code>csv.DictWriter()</code> object (see Reading and Writing
    CSV Files in Python on page
    248), passing in the file object and the headers.</li>
<li>Loop through each folder in BlueLeaks. You can get a list of all the
    filenames with <code>os.listdir(blueleaks_path)</code>.</li>
<li>Inside each BlueLeaks folder, open the <em>Company.csv</em> file if it
    exists, and loop through all of the rows in that CSV. For each row,
    select the information you want to save and then write it to your
    CSV.</li>
<li>Map out exactly what websites each BlueLeaks folder hosts in your
    output CSV.</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, the rest of this exercise will walk
you through the programming process. Start with the usual Python script
template in a file called <em>exercise-9-3.py</em>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">pass</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Next, modify your script to accept the <code>blueleaks_path</code> and <code>output_csv_path</code> command line arguments:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">click</span>

<span class="nd">@click</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">command</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="nd">@click</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">argument</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;blueleaks_path&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nd">@click</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">argument</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;output_csv_path&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">blueleaks_path</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">output_csv_path</span><span class="p">):</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Make a CSV that describes all the BlueLeaks folders&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You&rsquo;ve done this enough times at this point that you can safely assume
the arguments are working properly without testing the script.</p>
<h4>Open a CSV for Writing</h4>
<p>The simplest way to program this script is to first open a CSV file for
writing and then loop through each folder in BlueLeaks, adding rows to
this CSV. Start by just opening the CSV file for writing, using the
following code:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">click</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">csv</span>

<span class="nd">@click</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">command</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="nd">@click</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">argument</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;blueleaks_path&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nd">@click</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">argument</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;output_csv_path&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">blueleaks_path</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">output_csv_path</span><span class="p">):</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Make a CSV that describes all the BlueLeaks folders&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="n">headers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;BlueLeaksFolder&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;CompanyID&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;CompanyName&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;WebsiteTitle&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;URL&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">output_csv_path</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;w&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">output_f</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">writer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">csv</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">DictWriter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">output_f</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">fieldnames</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">headers</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">writer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">writeheader</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>First, the code imports the <code>csv</code> module. It then defines what the
headers of the output CSV will be in the variable <code>headers</code>. As noted in Reading and Writing CSV Files in Python, in order
to create a <code>csv.DictWriter()</code>
object, you&rsquo;ll need to pass in this list of headers for your CSV file.</p>
<p>Next, the code opens the output CSV file for writing, this time calling
it <code>output_f</code>, and creates the
<code>csv.DictWriter()</code> object,
saving it in the <code>writer</code>
variable. Finally, the program writes the header row to the CSV. To
write the remaining rows, you&rsquo;ll need to run <code>writer.writerow()</code>, passing in a dictionary that
represents the row.</p>
<p>Try running the script so far:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>micah@trapdoor chapter-9 % python3 exercise-9-3.py /Volumes/datasets/BlueLeaks-extracted sites
.csv
</code></pre></div>

<p>The script itself shouldn&rsquo;t display any output; it should just create an
output CSV file, <em>sites.csv</em>. Try displaying its contents using
<code>cat</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>micah@trapdoor chapter-9 % cat sites.csv
BlueLeaksFolder,CompanyID,CompanyName,WebsiteTitle,URL
</code></pre></div>

<p>You should see that the file currently contains only header rows.</p>
<h4>Find All the Company.csv Files</h4>
<p>Now that you can write rows to your CSV, the next step is to loop
through the BlueLeaks sites, looking for <em>Company.csv</em> files, using the
following code:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">click</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">csv</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os</span>

<span class="nd">@click</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">command</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="nd">@click</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">argument</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;blueleaks_path&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nd">@click</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">argument</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;output_csv_path&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">blueleaks_path</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">output_csv_path</span><span class="p">):</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Make a CSV that describes all the BlueLeaks folders&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="n">headers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;BlueLeaksFolder&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;CompanyID&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;CompanyName&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;WebsiteTitle&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;URL&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">output_csv_path</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;w&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">output_f</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">writer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">csv</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">DictWriter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">output_f</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">fieldnames</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">headers</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">writer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">writeheader</span><span class="p">()</span>

        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">folder_name</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">listdir</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">blueleaks_path</span><span class="p">):</span>
            <span class="n">company_csv_path</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">blueleaks_path</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">folder_name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Company.csv&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
            <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">exists</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">company_csv_path</span><span class="p">):</span>
                <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">company_csv_path</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This code imports the <code>os</code>
module. After creating the CSV writer, it loops through the return value
of the <code>os.listdir()</code>
function, which returns a list of all the files inside the BlueLeaks
folder. It then defines a new <code>company_csv _path</code> variable as the path to the
<em>Company.csv</em> file inside that BlueLeaks folder.
Finally, the <code>os.path.exists()</code> function makes sure that this specific
<em>Company.csv</em> file actually exists, and if so, the code displays its
path.</p>
<p>Try running the code so far:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>micah@trapdoor chapter-9 % python3 exercise-9-3.py /Volumes/datasets/BlueLeaks-extracted sites
.csv
/media/micah/datasets/BlueLeaks-extracted/vlnsn/Company.csv
/media/micah/datasets/BlueLeaks-extracted/njuasi/Company.csv
/media/micah/datasets/BlueLeaks-extracted/stopwesttexasgangs/Company.csv
--snip--
</code></pre></div>

<p>As you can see, the script displays paths for all of the <em>Company.csv</em>
files in BlueLeaks. (Yours might display them in a different order than
mine.)</p>
<h4>Add BlueLeaks Sites to the CSV</h4>
<p>The final step is to open all the <em>Company.csv</em> files whose paths you&rsquo;ve
just listed, loop through their rows, and add new rows to your output
CSV file based on them:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">click</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">csv</span>

<p>The added code opens the
<code>company_csv_path</code>, this time
for reading instead of writing, and now calling the file object
<code>input_f</code>. It then creates a
<code>csv.DictReader()</code> object to
read the data from this CSV and loops through its rows.</p>
<p>For each row, the code creates a new dictionary called
<code>output_row</code> that contains the
name of the BlueLeaks folder you&rsquo;re currently working in, as well as
CompanyID, CompanyName, WebsiteTitle, and URL from <em>Company.csv</em>. It
then uses the CSV writer you created in the previous section to save
that row to your output CSV file. When the code finishes looping through
all of the rows in a <em>Company.csv</em> file, it displays a message to show
it&rsquo;s done with that folder.</p>
<p>You can find the complete script at
<a href="https://github.com/micahflee/hacks-leaks-and-revelations/blob/main/chapter-9/exercise-9-3.py">https://github.com/micahflee/hacks-leaks-and-revelations/blob/main/chapter-9/exercise-9-3.py</a>.
Run your final script like so:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>micah@trapdoor chapter-9 % python3 exercise-9-3.py /Volumes/datasets/BlueLeaks-extracted sites
.csv
Finished: vlnsn
Finished: njuasi
Finished: stopwesttexasgangs
--snip--
</code></pre></div>

<p>When you run this script, the output displays a line for each BlueLeaks
folder showing that it has finished running. But more importantly, it
creates the file <em>sites.csv</em>. Figure 9-9 shows
what that file looks like in LibreOffice Calc.</p>

<em>Figure 9-9: The CSV output created by the final Exercise 9-3 script</em></p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve created the CSV, you can use your
graphical spreadsheet software to freeze the header row at the top and
sort the columns however you&rsquo;d like. If you live in the US, try finding
the fusion center that covers your region; that might be a good place to
start digging. You can use the skills you&rsquo;ve learned in this chapter and
the Python scripts you&rsquo;ve written to make the files for your chosen
fusion center easier to work with.</p>
<p>Before you get too deep into your BlueLeaks investigations, though, I
recommend reading Chapter 10, where I&rsquo;ll
introduce you to software that might save you time and allow you to
uncover more interesting revelations.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In this chapter, you started investigating CSV spreadsheets. You&rsquo;ve
learned how to open and examine them using spreadsheet software, as well
as how to read and write them using Python code, sharpening your
programming skills along the way. You&rsquo;ve also learned more about the
BlueLeaks dataset structure and how to find hidden details, such as who
posted which SARs and what documents were sent out as part of which bulk
email messages, in the spreadsheets.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve explored just a few CSVs in BlueLeaks so far, including
<em>SARs.csv</em> and <em>EmailBuilder.csv</em> in NCRIC and <em>Company.csv</em> in all of
the folders, but there&rsquo;s still much more to investigate. In the next
chapter, you&rsquo;ll learn how to research the BlueLeaks dataset in depth
using my custom-built software, BlueLeaks Explorer.</p>
