                        the Associated Press Stylebook on every journalists bookshelf. As our
                        world continues to become exponentially more data-driven, having the
                        skills to access and analyze such information is no longer a luxury,
                        but a requirement. Lee wastes no time in providing you with the
                        essential tools and skills needed to begin digging through the next big
                        data leak.”</p>
