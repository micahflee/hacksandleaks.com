Even when our private data doesn't get sent directly to tech companies,
our devices still record our every move locally. Can you name every
single web page you visited last month? Your web browser probably can,
and so can web trackers that follow your activity across the internet.

In addition to the constant background surveillance that everyone faces,
workers with access to sensitive datasets are often under even stricter
corporate or government surveillance. Their work computers and phones
come preinstalled with spyware that monitors everything they do.
Database systems keep track of exactly who searches for which search
terms and when, and which documents they open, download, or print.

It's in this environment that ordinary people
find themselves becoming sources. Through the course of their work, they
witness something unethical or disturbing. They might make a folder with
incriminating documents, or take screenshots of the company chat, or do
some searches on internal databases to learn more and make sure their
suspicions are correct. They might email themselves some documents or
copy files to a USB stick that they plug into their work computer. They
might text their friends or family for advice while thinking about what
to do next. Most sources aren't aware of the massive digital trail that
they've already left by the time they reach out to a journalist or
regulator.

In this chapter, you'll learn about protecting sources and securing the
datasets you obtain from them. I'll go over the editorial and ethical
considerations involved in redacting documents and deciding what
information to publish, as well as where you should store datasets based
on how sensitive they are. I'll show you how to verify that datasets are
authentic, describing how I've done so in the past for hacked data from
COVID-19 pandemic profiteers and chat logs from WikiLeaks. Verifying the
authenticity of datasets is not only important to writing accurate
stories but also critical to protecting your reputation as a journalist.
Finally, you'll learn how to use password managers, encrypt disks, and
protect yourself from malicious documents.


### Safely Communicating with Sources

Because everything we do leaves a data trail, protecting sources is
complicated and difficult. After you publish a blockbuster report based
on information you've obtained from an anonymous whistleblower, you
should expect the target of your investigation to launch an
investigation of their own into your source's identity. The balance of
power between a confidential source and the investigators on their trail
is extremely asymmetric. If you're a journalist or researcher trying to
protect your source, even doing all the right things perfectly isn't
always enough. Because so much of source protection is beyond your
control, it's important to focus on the handful of things that aren't.

As a journalist or researcher, verifying that data you've obtained is
authentic is one of your core responsibilities. The simplest way to
authenticate documents is to ask the company or government that produced
them if they're real, but this is fraught with risk to your source. In
some cases, you don't want to give up any details that might reveal your
source's identity. I'll discuss this further in the Authenticating
Datasets section later in this chapter. You also might not want
to reveal that specific documents have been leaked, a topic you'll learn
more about in this chapter's Redaction section.

In this section, I'll describe which sources face risks and which don't,
as well as strategies for reducing those risks. I'll also discuss the
differences between working with confidential sources who have
legitimate access to inside information and hackers who break the law to
obtain it. It's important to carefully consider how your
own choices as an investigator could impact your source, preferably
before you even begin speaking with one.


#### Working with Public Data

Some datasets don't pose any risk to the source at all. When the
government publishes a set of documents in response to a public records
request or when documents are made public as part of a lawsuit, you can
include as much of the data as you like in your report. This data might
contain revelations that powerful people don't want anyone to know, but
sharing those won't put anyone at risk of retaliation, since the data is
already public.

Similarly, you don't need to worry about source protection for datasets
that may contain sensitive data but are public and widely available,
such as the BlueLeaks dataset you'll download in Chapter 2. Any information you discover from that
dataset has already been scoured by the FBI investigators trying to
determine who the hacker was. In these cases, it doesn't matter how many
people had access to the documents. There's no chance of accidentally
burning your source by providing too many details to a government or
corporate media office when you ask if the data is real and if they have
a statement. Since the dataset is already public, any damage to the
source has already been done.



#### Protecting Sensitive Information

If you're dealing with a dataset from a *confidential* source, revealing
their identity could cause your source to be fired, arrested, or even
murdered. The most basic step you should take to protect your source is
to simply not talk about them with anyone that isn't closely
collaborating with you on your investigation. Don't post to social media
any details about your source that you're not planning on making public,
don't talk about them to your friends at parties, and don't even talk
about them to colleagues who aren't involved in the investigation.

If you're interviewing a company or government agency about a leaked
dataset you've obtained, don't give them any details about your
confidential source, even if they directly ask. If you get arrested and
the police are demanding to know who your source is, you have the right
to remain silent, and you should exercise it: don't give the police any
information they don't already have. The only time that you're obligated
to reveal information about your source is if a judge orders you
to&mdash;and even then, you can resist it.



#### Minimizing the Digital Trail

Be sure to leave the smallest digital trail possible when communicating
with your source. As much as you can, avoid communication by email, SMS
messages, phone calls, direct messages in social media apps, and so on.
Don't follow your confidential source on social media, and make sure
they don't follow you.

If you must send messages or make calls, use an encrypted messaging app
like Signal, which I'll cover in Chapter 2,
and make sure your source deletes any records of their
chats with you. You'll often need to record what your source told you in
order to report on it, but take steps to protect those records, such as
removing them from messaging apps on your phone and keeping them locally
on your computer rather than in a cloud service. If you no longer need
your own records of conversations after you've published your
report&mdash;for potential follow-up stories, for example&mdash;then delete
them.

Make sure your source knows not to search the internet for you or for
the reports you've published in a way that could be associated with
them. Google search history has been used as evidence against sources in
the past. For example, in 2018, Treasury Department whistleblower
Natalie Mayflower Sours Edwards was indicted for allegedly providing a
secret dataset to BuzzFeed journalist Jason Leopold. The documents she
was accused of leaking detailed suspicious financial transactions
involving Republican Party operatives, senior members of Donald Trump's
2020 election campaign, and a Kremlin-connected Russian agent and
Russian oligarchs. During the leak investigation, the FBI obtained a
search warrant to access her internet search history, and her indictment
accused her of searching for multiple articles based on the contents of
her alleged leaks shortly after they were published.



#### Working with Hackers and Whistleblowers

The steps you must take to protect your source vary greatly depending on
the person's technical sophistication. Not all sources are
*whistleblowers*, people with inside access to datasets or documents who
leak evidence of wrongdoing for ethical reasons. Sometimes your source
may be a *hacktivist* who wants to bring down companies or government
agencies that they find unjust.

Unlike most whistleblowers, hackers tend to understand that they're
under surveillance and that everything they do leaves a digital trail,
so they usually take countermeasures to hide their tracks. It's common
for whistleblowers to reveal their identities to journalists for
verification reasons, even if they aren't publicly named, but hackers
typically remain fully anonymous. However, hackers can often provide
technical information you can use to independently authenticate a
dataset using open source intelligence. As with any source, you can't
necessarily trust what hackers tell you, but their expertise can help
you independently verify that the data they sent you is authentic. For
these reasons, there's often less risk to your source when you publish
documents from hackers rather than from whistleblowers.

When communicating with a hacker source, it's important that you stick
to your role as a journalist or researcher. In the US, you're not
breaking any laws just by speaking with a source who's a hacker, but
*your source is almost certainly breaking laws* by hacking into
companies or governments and stealing data. Don't do anything that could
be construed as conspiring with them. For example, don't ask them to get
specific data for you; let them give you whatever data they choose. If
you're a journalist working with an established newsroom, you might fare
better against legal threats than a
freelancer would. While everyone should be protected equally under the
law, newsrooms often have resources like lawyers and defense funds. When
you're not sure whether something you're doing could get you in trouble,
consult a lawyer.

Sometimes sources pretend to be hacktivists or whistleblowers but are
actually state-sponsored hackers. For instance, Russian military hackers
posed as hacktivists when they compromised the Democratic Party and
Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in 2016, interfering with the US
election by sending hacked datasets to WikiLeaks. This sort of dataset
might be authentic and newsworthy, but you don't want to end up being a
pawn in someone else's information warfare. If you're unsure about your
source's credibility or believe that they might have ulterior
motives&mdash;or if you're confident that they're being dishonest with
you&mdash;it's important to mention your skepticism about your source, and
why you have doubts, in your reporting. WikiLeaks did the opposite: it
insisted its source wasn't Russian intelligence when it knew otherwise,
and it even spread the conspiracy theory that Seth Rich, a Democratic
Party employee who was murdered, was the group's real source, leading to
years of harassment against Rich's family members.

### Secure Storage for Datasets

As you prepare to receive a dataset from a source, first assess how
sensitive you think that dataset is, since this will inform how you
should go about protecting it, as well as how you'll continue protecting
your source. As mentioned, some datasets are completely public, while
others are highly classified national security secrets, and others are
somewhere in between. You might encounter a dataset with unique
challenges that doesn't fit into one of these categories, but in
general, there are three different levels of sensitivity: low, medium,
and high.

#### Low-Sensitivity Datasets

A dataset might be low sensitivity if it meets one of the following
criteria:

-   It's already completely public, such as documents in response to a
    public records request or public datasets that anyone can download
    from a transparency collective like Distributed Denial of Secrets.
    (You'll learn more about DDoSecrets in Chapter 2.)
-   Law enforcement or an adversarial corporation has already gained
    access to the dataset, meaning how you store it won't lead to
    retaliation against your source.
-   It doesn't contain *personal identifiable information*, or *PII*,
    which I describe in detail in the Redaction section on page 14.

Basically, if you can't think of any harm that would result if a given
dataset is shared more widely than you intended, including with law
enforcement or leak investigators, it's probably low sensitivity.

It's safe to work with low-sensitivity datasets
in *the cloud*, by which I mean storage services like Google Drive,
iCloud, and Dropbox; hosting services like Amazon Web Services (AWS);
and any other service where anyone besides you and the people you're
working with will have access to the data. Cloud services are all
vulnerable to legal requests, however, so if you're investigating
governments or corporations with powerful lawyers, they can send
subpoenas to cloud providers to get data associated with your account.
Additionally, the data you store in the cloud is only as safe as your
account itself. Make sure you have a strong password and turn on
features like two-factor authentication to make your account
significantly more difficult to hack.

#### Medium-Sensitivity Datasets

Most datasets that aren't low sensitivity are medium sensitivity; that
is, they're not already public, but securing them doesn't require you to
go to extreme measures. For example, a dataset I describe later in this
chapter that includes medical records of hundreds of thousands of
patients is medium sensitivity. These datasets should be stored on disks
that are *encrypted*, or locked in such a way that only the owner should
be able to unlock them to access the data. This way, if your laptop is
stolen, lost, or seized in a police raid, no one can access your files.
If you haven't already encrypted your disk, you'll do so in Exercises
1-1 and 1-2.

Medium-sensitivity data should also stay on your computer's hard disk or
a removable disk. Avoid storing it in cloud services unless you have a
good reason to do so or you're able to encrypt it in way that the cloud
service can't decrypt it. Storing datasets on local encrypted disks
greatly reduces the risk of anyone else gaining unauthorized access to
them.

You can work with medium-sensitivity data on your typical work computer,
as long as you secure your machine. Here's how:

-   Make sure your computer's hard disk is encrypted.
-   Take steps to protect your computer physically. Make sure the screen
    locks automatically after a short amount of inactivity and requires
    a password to unlock.
-   Install software updates promptly, and be wary of what programs you
    install and what documents you open on your computer. If you
    accidentally run malicious software or open a malicious document,
    someone could hack your computer and gain access to your datasets.
-   Store the dataset on an external USB disk, which allows you to store
    more data than will fit on your computer and means you can travel
    with your laptop without worrying about protecting the datasets
    stored on it. Make sure your external disk is encrypted as well (see
    the Disk Encryption section on page 21 for
    instructions).
-   Don't store files in parts of your computer that are automatically
    uploaded to the cloud. For example, many Mac users configure their
    computers to upload their *Documents* folder to iCloud, Apple's
    cloud storage service. If your computer is set up
    this way, don't put files related to these investigations in that
    folder.

In general, work with medium-security data *locally*, meaning as files
stored on your hard disk that aren't exposed to any online services. In
some cases it's reasonable to work with medium-security datasets
remotely. If you're working with other people, you may need to use an
encrypted file-sharing solution so that the service you're using can't
decrypt the files, but you and your colleagues can. One simple option is
to send files back and forth using the Signal messenger app. And if you
or your organization is hosting a secure tool for searching datasets,
such as Aleph (covered in Chapter 5), it's
also reasonable to copy the data into that tool.

All of the datasets you'll be working with in this book are low
sensitivity, since they're already public. The techniques you'll learn
throughout the book will apply for medium-sensitivity datasets as well,
however, as you'll work with the data locally on your computer. While
it's fine to work with these particular datasets in the cloud, learning
to work with them locally will give you the practice you need for
handling more sensitive datasets.



#### High-Sensitivity Datasets

High-sensitivity datasets are by far the most difficult to work with,
for good reason. The Snowden Archive, for example, is high sensitivity.
I spent years reporting on this massive trove of secret government
documents from National Security Agency (NSA) whistleblower Edward
Snowden, who exposed the fact that US and allied spy agencies were
conducting warrantless surveillance and privacy invasions on an
unimaginable scale. We didn't want the FBI or NSA to gain access to it,
which made cloud services out of the question, but more important, we
didn't want foreign intelligence services to access it either. We
assumed that nation-state attackers had the capability to remotely hack
pretty much any computer we used unless we took steps to make sure it
never connected to any remote network.

Going into detail on how to conduct high-sensitivity investigations is
beyond the scope of this book, and you won't need such skills to work
through later chapters. However, for future reference, this section
outlines how you should proceed if you find yourself working with a
cache of top-secret documents.

If a dataset is high sensitivity, until you are close to publishing your
report, store it or access it only using *air-gapped* computers&mdash;those
that never connect to the internet. Move files off the air-gapped
computer only when they're already redacted and necessary for
publishing. In short, buy a new computer, never connect it to the
internet, and use that. Or, if you have an old computer that would work,
you can format its disk, reinstall the operating system, and use that
computer while never connecting it to the internet. These steps will
help you ensure that you're starting from a clean system free of
existing trackers or malware. To make it even more secure, unscrew the
computer's case and physically remove the wireless hardware.

You'll run into all sorts of challenges related
to moving data between your air-gapped computer and your normal work
computer&mdash;for example, installing or updating software on your
air-gapped computer requires downloading it on another computer,
carefully verifying that it's legitimate software, and then transferring
it to your air-gapped computer to install it. The extra steps are worth
it, though, when a breach might have severe consequences.

It's also important that the disk in your air-gapped computer and any
USB disks that you use with it are encrypted with strong passphrases.
Also consider the physical security of where you store your air-gapped
computer and USB disks. If possible, keep them in a safe or vault with a
good lock. If that's not possible, at least keep them in a locked room
to which few people have keys. Always power off your air-gapped computer
when you're not using it to make it harder for attacks against the disk
encryption to work.

When working on air-gapped computers, be mindful of nearby
internet-connected electronic devices with microphones or cameras. Avoid
having conversations related to highly sensitive documents within
earshot of microphones, and consider whether any nearby cameras
(including smartphones) could capture photographs of your screen.

### Authenticating Datasets

You can't believe everything you read on the internet, and juicy
documents or datasets that anonymous people send you are no exception.
Disinformation is prevalent. It's important to explain in your published
report, at least briefly, what makes you confident in the data. If you
can't authenticate it but still want to publish your report in case it's
real&mdash;or in case others *can* authenticate it&mdash;make that clear. When
in doubt, err on the side of transparency.

How you go about verifying that a dataset is authentic completely
depends on what the data is. You have to approach the problem on a
case-by-case basis. The best way to verify a dataset is to use *open
source intelligence (OSINT)*, or publicly available information that
anyone with enough skill can find. This might mean scouring social media
accounts, consulting the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine
([https://web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org)),
inspecting metadata of public images or documents, paying services for
historical domain name registration data, or viewing other types of
public records. If your dataset includes a database taken from a
website, for instance, you might be able to compare information in that
database with publicly available information on the website itself to
confirm that they match.

This book's discussion of OSINT focuses on how I've used it in my own
investigations. If you want to learn more, see Michael Bazzell's *OSINT
Techniques: Resources for Uncovering Online Information*, along with the
companion tools listed at
[https://inteltechniques.com/tools](https://inteltechniques.com/tools).
Bazzell describes a large number of tools and techniques for discovering
details that might help you verify datasets using OSINT.

In this section, I'll share two examples of authenticating data from my
own experience: one about a dataset from the anti-vaccine group
America's Frontline Doctors, and another about leaked chat logs from a
WikiLeaks Twitter group.

**NOTE:** *In 2023, Twitter rebranded itself as X. In this book, I will continue
to refer to accounts and posts that existed before this rebranding as
"Twitter accounts" and "tweets."* 


#### The AFLDS Dataset

In late 2021, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, an anonymous hacker
sent me hundreds of thousands of patient and prescription records from
telehealth companies working with America's Frontline Doctors (AFLDS).
AFLDS is a far-right anti-vaccine group that misleads people about
COVID-19 vaccine safety and tricks patients into paying millions of
dollars for drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, which are
ineffective at preventing or treating the virus. The group was initially
formed to help Donald Trump's 2020 reelection campaign, and the group's
leader, Simone Gold, was arrested for storming the US Capitol on January
6, 2021. In 2022, she served two months in prison for her role in the
attack.

My source told me that they got the data by writing a program that made
thousands of web requests to a website run by one of the telehealth
companies, Cadence Health. Each request returned data about a different
patient. To see whether that was true, I made an account on the Cadence
Health website myself. Everything looked legitimate to me. The
information I had about each of the 255,000 patients was the exact
information I was asked to provide when I created my account on the
service, and various category names and IDs in the dataset matched what
I could see on the website. But how could I be confident that the
patient data itself was real, that these people weren't just made up?

I wrote a simple Python script to loop through the 72,000 patients
(those who had paid for fake health care) and put each of their email
addresses in a text file. I then cross-referenced these email addresses
with a totally separate dataset containing PII from members of Gab, a
social network popular among fascists, anti-democracy activists, and
anti-vaxxers. In early 2021, a hacktivist who went by the name "JaXpArO
and My Little Anonymous Revival Project" had hacked Gab and made off
with 65GB of data, including about 38,000 Gab users' email addresses.
Thinking there might be overlap between AFLDS and Gab users, I wrote
another simple Python program that compared the email addresses from
each group and showed me all of the addresses that were in both lists.
There were several.

Armed with this information, I started scouring the public Gab timelines
of users whose email addresses had appeared in both datasets, looking
for posts about AFLDS. Using this technique, I found multiple AFLDS
patients who posted about their experience on Gab, leading me to believe
that the data was authentic. For example, according to consultation
notes from the hacked dataset, one patient created an account on the
telehealth site and four days later had a telehealth consultation. About
a month after that, they posted to Gab saying, "Front line doctors
finally came through with HCQ/Zinc delivery" (HCQ is an abbreviation for
hydroxychloroquine).

Chapter 13 focuses entirely on my AFLDS
investigation and describes the technical details of my Python script in
greater depth. By the time you've worked through the
intervening chapters, you'll have the Python knowledge to understand how
that script worked.



#### The WikiLeaks Twitter Group Chat

In late 2017, journalist Julia Ioffe published a revelation in the
*Atlantic*: WikiLeaks had slid into Donald Trump Jr.'s Twitter direct
messages (DMs). Among other things, before the 2016 election, WikiLeaks
suggested to Trump Jr. that even if his father lost the election, he
shouldn't concede. "Hi Don," the verified @WikiLeaks Twitter account wrote, "if your father 'loses' we think it is much more interesting if he DOES NOT conceed \[*sic*\] and spends time CHALLENGING
the media and other types of rigging that occurred&mdash;as he has implied
that he might do."

A long-term WikiLeaks volunteer who went by the pseudonym Hazelpress
started a private Twitter group with WikiLeaks and its biggest
supporters in mid-2015. After watching the group become more right-wing,
conspiratorial, and unethical, and specifically after learning about
WikiLeaks' secret DMs with Trump Jr., Hazelpress decided to blow the
whistle on the whistleblowing group itself. She has since publicly come
forward as Mary-Emma Holly, an artist who spent years as a volunteer
legal researcher for WikiLeaks.

To carry out the WikiLeaks leak, Holly logged in to her Twitter account,
made it private, unfollowed everyone, and deleted all of her tweets. She
also deleted all of her DMs except for the private WikiLeaks Twitter
group and changed her Twitter username. Using the Firefox web browser,
she then went to the DM conversation&mdash;which contained 11,000 messages
and had been going on for two and a half years&mdash;and saw the latest
messages in the group. She scrolled up, waited for Twitter to load more
messages, scrolled up again, and kept doing this for *four hours*, until
she reached the very first message in the group. She then used Firefox's
Save Page As function to save an HTML version of the web page, as well
as a folder full of resources like images that were posted in the group.

Now that she had a local, offline copy of all the messages in the DM
group, Holly leaked it to the media. In early 2018, she sent a Signal
message to the phone number listed on The Intercept's tips page. At that
time, I happened to be the one checking Signal for incoming tips. Using
OnionShare&mdash;software that I developed for this purpose, which I
describe in detail in Chapter 2&mdash;she sent
me an encrypted and compressed file, along with the password to decrypt
it. After extracting it, I found a 37MB HTML file&mdash;so big that it made
my web browser unresponsive when I tried opening it, and which I later
split into separate files to make it easier to work with&mdash;and a folder
with 82MB of resources.

How could I verify the authenticity of such a huge HTML file? If I could
somehow access the same data directly from Twitter's servers, that would
do it; only an insider at Twitter would be in a position to create fake
DMs that show up on Twitter's website, and even that would be extremely
challenging. When I explained this to Holly (who, at the time, I still
knew only as Hazelpress), she gave me her Twitter username and password.
She had already deleted all the other information from
that account. With her consent, I logged in to Twitter with her
credentials, went to her DMs, and found the Twitter group in question.
It immediately looked like it contained the same messages as the HTML
file, and I confirmed that the verified account
@WikiLeaks frequently posted to the group.

Following these steps made me extremely confident in the authenticity of
the dataset, but I decided to take verification one step further. Could
I download a separate copy of the Twitter group myself in order to
compare it with the version Holly had sent me? I searched around and
found DMArchiver, a Python program that could do just that.
Using this program, along with Holly's username and
password, I downloaded a text version of all of the DMs in the Twitter
group. It took only a few minutes to run this tool, rather than four
hours of scrolling up in a web browser.

**NOTE** *After this investigation, the DMArchiver program stopped working due to
changes on Twitter's end, and today the project is abandoned. However,
if you're faced with a similar challenge in a future investigation,
search for a tool that might work for you. You could also consider
developing your own, using programming skills that you'll learn in
Chapters 7 and 8.*

The output from DMArchiver, a 1.7MB text file, was much
easier to work with compared to the enormous HTML file, and it also
included exact timestamps. Here's a snippet of the text
version:

```
[2015-11-19 13:46:39] <WikiLeaks> We believe it would be much better for GOP to win.
[2015-11-19 13:47:28] <WikiLeaks> Dems+Media+liberals woudl then form a block to reign in their worst qualities.
[2015-11-19 13:48:22] <WikiLeaks> With Hillary in charge, GOP will be pushing for her worst qualities., dems+media+neoliberals will be mute.
[2015-11-19 13:50:18] <WikiLeaks> She's a bright, well connected, sadistic sociopath.
```

I could view the HTML version in a web browser to see it exactly as it
had originally looked on Twitter, which was also useful for taking
screenshots to include in our final report, as shown in Figure 1-1.

![`Figure 1-1: A screenshot of the leaked HTML file`](media/images/Figure1-1.png)  
*Figure 1-1: A screenshot of the leaked HTML file*

Along with the talented reporter Cora Currier, I started the long process of reading all 11,000 chat
messages, paying closest attention to the 10 percent of them from
the @WikiLeaks account&mdash;which was
presumably controlled by Julian Assange, WikiLeaks'
editor&mdash;and picking out everything in the public interest. We
discovered the following details:

-   Assange expressed a desire for Republicans to win the 2016
    presidential election.
-   Assange and his supporters were intensely focused on discrediting
    two Swedish women who had accused him of rape and molestation, as
    well as discrediting their lawyers. Assange and his defenders spent
    weeks discussing ways to sabotage articles about his rape case that
    feminist journalists were writing.
-   Assange tried to discredit filmmaker Laura Poitras because of how
    she portrayed him in *Risk*, the 2016 documentary about WikiLeaks.
    The film includes a scene in which Assange tells his lawyer that his
    accusers were part of a "thoroughly tawdry radical feminist
    political positioning thing," and in another scene he says, "Part of
    the problem in this case is there's two women, and the public just
    can't even keep them separate. If there was one, you could go,
    'She's a bad woman.' I think that would have happened by now."
-   Assange used transphobic and misogynistic language when talking
    about Chelsea Manning, his source from 2010, and her friends. I
    discuss Manning's relationship with WikiLeaks further in Chapter 2.
-   After Associated Press journalist Raphael Satter wrote a story about
    harm caused when WikiLeaks publishes personal identifiable
    information, Assange called him a "rat" and said that, "he's Jewish
    and engaged in the ((())) issue," referring to an antisemitic
    neo-Nazi meme. He then told his supporters to "Bog him down. Get him
    to show his bias."

You can read our reporting on this dataset at
[https://theintercept.com/2018/02/14/julian-assange-wikileaks-election-clinton-trump/](https://theintercept.com/2018/02/14/julian-assange-wikileaks-election-clinton-trump/).
After The Intercept published this article, Assange and his supporters
also targeted me personally with antisemitic abuse, and Russia Today,
the state-run TV station, ran a segment about me. I discuss WikiLeaks
and its history in greater depth in Chapter 2.

The techniques you can use to authenticate datasets vary greatly
depending on the situation. Sometimes you can rely on OSINT, sometimes
you can rely on help from your source, and sometimes you'll need to come
up with an entirely different method.




### Redaction

Once you've authenticated your dataset, you must consider whether or how
you want to redact&mdash;that is, hide or delete&mdash;sensitive information
before publishing the results of your investigation. In some cases it
might be safe to publish original documents without any redaction, and
in others you might choose not to publish any
documents at all. In this section I'll discuss how to make these
decisions and the reasons you might choose to redact, or not redact,
information.


#### What Data to Publish

When deciding how much data to publish, consider whether your method of
reporting the revelations will enable leak investigators to uncover your
source. For example, if a company's human resources department sends an
email to all of its 10,000 employees and one of them leaks the message
to you, it will be very hard for the company to find the culprit. But if
only 10 people have access to a document&mdash;or database logs show a list
of 10 people who recently accessed it&mdash;the company has a real suspect
list to work from.

How many people had access to the data you've obtained, how sensitive it
is, what your source is risking, and what they're comfortable with are
all factors that will determine the different types or quantities of
data you publish. The following list provides options to consider,
ordered from the most risk to your source to the least:

-   Publish unaltered documents or datasets.
-   Publish documents after you've redacted them and stripped them of
    metadata.
-   Publish documents after re-creating them from scratch by typing them
    by hand into new separate documents and publishing those instead.
    When you re-create documents, you remove any hidden trackers and
    make it impossible to tell from the documents themselves whether
    your source obtained them by photographing their screen, copying
    them to a USB stick, uploading them to a website, or using some
    other method.
-   Don't publish the documents at all; only describe and quote from
    them.
-   Don't even quote from the documents, just describe the revelations
    they contain. If leak investigators don't know what documents were
    compromised, only that an accurate news story somehow reveals
    confidential information, they'll have a harder time making progress
    in their investigation.

Publishing documents is more transparent to your readers, and providing
direct evidence makes your work more credible, but doing so has to be
weighed against protecting your source. You'll make these decisions on a
case-by-case basis, but always keep in mind the risks that your source
faces.



#### What to Redact

If you've carefully considered the risks to your source and decided to
publish documents rather than just describing them, the next step is to
decide what, if any, information in those documents to redact before
publishing. There are three reasons for redaction: to continue
protecting your source, to protect the privacy of others involved, or to
protect government or corporate information that should justifiably
remain secret.


##### Protecting Your Source

If your dataset includes archives of a private website or databases that
your source was logged in to, you'll want to redact their username or
any other identifying information before publishing. In addition, make
sure you don't accidentally publish metadata that could reveal your
source. This book won't describe the many ways that could happen, but
here are two common examples: Word documents often include the name of
the author, and photos often include GPS coordinates and the type of
camera that was used.

In 2012, John McAfee, the controversial millionaire software executive,
was on the run. Police raided his home in Belize, and he fled the
country. In a blog post, he wrote, "I am currently safe and in the
company of two intrepid journalist \[*sic*\] from Vice Magazine ... We
are not in Belize, but not quite out of the woods yet." That day, *Vice*
published its article about McAfee, which included a photograph.
According to the photo's metadata, it was taken on an iPhone 4S and
included GPS coordinates to a specific house in Guatemala. By not
stripping the photo of metadata, *Vice* accidentally published his exact
location. If *Vice* had simply taken a screenshot of the image and
published that instead, the magazine would have erased the metadata and
kept the location secret.

In 2017, when President Donald Trump constantly called the accusations
that Russia interfered in the US elections "fake news," NSA
whistleblower Reality Winner anonymously mailed a top-secret document to
The Intercept with evidence that the NSA had, in fact, witnessed a
Russian cyberattack against local election officials. The Intercept
published the document, and a short time later Reality Winner was
arrested. The published document included a type of metadata called
*printer dots*, nearly invisible yellow dots that printers add to paper
that include the serial number of the printer and the timestamp of when
it was printed. While there's no evidence that leak investigators even
noticed them until after Reality Winner was arrested (she was one of six
people who had printed this document, and the only one who had written
an email to The Intercept), the printer dots could have outed her as
well. The Intercept could have mitigated this by re-creating the
document (retyping it and re-creating the artwork) and publishing that
instead of a scanned version of the original.



##### Protecting Personal Information in Datasets

Many datasets include names, email addresses, usernames, phone numbers,
home addresses, passwords, and other similar personal identifiable
information of people who aren't public figures. Many government and
corporate documents include PII for random employees that won't add
anything to your story but could make these people targets of
harassment. Even when dealing with public figures, in most cases it's
still responsible to redact their PII unless publishing it adds value to
your report. For example, if the focus of your investigation is a lavish
mansion owned by a billionaire, it might be reasonable to publish the
address of that mansion. If you're writing an
unrelated story about that billionaire, however, there's no reason to
include their home address.

Even if you believe the targets of your investigation are jerks, it's
better to redact their PII if including it doesn't add to your report.
Even jerks have privacy rights, and needlessly publishing PII could be
used to discredit your report regardless of the revelations it contains.

The exception to this rule is if publicly outing someone is an important
part of your story and could keep other people safe. For example, it's
ethical to name someone who is abusive in a workplace or industry or to
out someone as a member of a hate group. Even when you're publicly
outing someone, though, don't publish unnecessary PII about them, like
their home address. If you do, you might be accused of harassment, which
could distract the conversation from the wrongdoing you're trying to
expose.



##### Protecting Legitimate Secrets

Occasionally, governments and companies do in fact have legitimate
reasons to keep secrets. In my experience, this is rare&mdash;the US
government has a severe overclassification problem. This is one reason
it's important to ask related parties for comment before you publish
your story, though: a government agency or company may give you context
that could make you decide not to publicize the data. For example, I was
once part of a decision to redact details from a top-secret US
government document related to another country's nuclear weapons
program.





### Making Requests for Comment

Always give the people or companies on which you're reporting a chance
to tell their side of the story. Even if you're confident that they
won't respond truthfully or at all, you should still attempt to contact
them, explain what you're going to publish, and give them a chance to
defend themselves. If they do respond, quote their response in your
published report (and if you know they aren't telling the truth, explain
that alongside their quote). If they don't respond or they decline to
comment, include that in your report as well.

For example, in 2017, I reported on leaked chat logs from
neo-Nazis, which I cover in Chapter 14. In
my article, I named a member of the pro-slavery hate group League of the
South who was arrested during the deadly Charlottesville, Virginia,
Unite the Right protest for carrying a concealed handgun. He had posted
messages in a chatroom saying that he had "scores to settle" with local
antifascists because they had gotten him fired from his job. Using
public records, I tracked down his phone number. I set up a new virtual
phone number using Google Voice and called him with that, since I didn't
want to give him my private number. I left messages, but he never
responded.

If your investigation is adversarial&mdash;that is, the people you're
looking into aren't going to be happy about it&mdash;wait until shortly
before you publish your report to contact them and
tip your hand. It's polite to give them at least 24 hours to respond,
while giving them less time to sabotage your story. They might leak your
story to a friendly publication to publish first with a positive spin,
announce to their followers that a hit piece is coming, or attempt to
use legal means to stop you from publishing. I've been involved in
investigations where all of those scenarios have happened.

Chances are, you're not an expert in all aspects of what you're
reporting on, so it's often a good idea to consult outside experts
(university professors, authors, scientists, and so on) and include
quotes from them in your published reports. In my own reporting, I've
interviewed cryptography professors, disinformation researchers, medical
doctors, and civil rights advocates who work for nonprofits. Even if
you're an expert on the topic of your investigation, providing outside
voices often adds to your story, helping you make stronger arguments.

As long as you trust the experts you're talking with, it's fine to
contact them early in the reporting process. It's also common to share
confidential documents with them, so long as they agree to keep them
secret until you publish. In the case of highly sensitive documents, you
might need to arrange for outside experts to visit you in person and
view the files on your air-gapped computer. Sometimes these experts can
point you in research directions that you wouldn't think to go yourself.

Now that you've seen how to protect your sources and authenticate the
information they give you, let's go over some ways to secure your
computer and online accounts to keep your datasets and other sensitive
records safe.



### Password Managers

Most people's passwords aren't unique, meaning they're reused in
multiple places. This is a very bad idea, since any duplicate password
is only as secure as the least secure place you've used it. Go to
[https://haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com),
search for your email address or phone number, and you'll see a list of
data breaches that you're included in. If your LinkedIn password was
exposed in a data breach a few years ago but it's the same password you
use for your Gmail account, to log in to your laptop, or to unlock your
encrypted USB disk full of sensitive datasets, you may be in trouble.

The solution is to make all your passwords unique as well as strong,
which really just means long and random enough that they're impossible
to predict. Unfortunately, strong passwords are hard to memorize, and
it's impossible for humans to memorize hundreds of passwords that are
both strong and unique. Yet we're required to use hundreds of passwords
in our daily lives.

Fortunately, we can have computers memorize most of our passwords for
us. Password managers are programs that keep track of an encrypted
database of passwords that you unlock using a master password, the only
one you have to memorize. Password managers often allow you to sync your
password database to the cloud, which is fine so long as you're using a
strong master password. If a hacker steals your encrypted password
database or if your password manager company
hands it to the FBI or other authorities, they won't be able to unlock
it without your master password. An encrypted password database is
completely inaccessible to anyone without the master password. If your
master password is strong, it will be literally impossible for them to
guess it, and your other passwords will be safe. Encryption is cool like
that.

> #### DONALD TRUMP’S TWITTER PASSWORD
> 
> I learned from an episode of the excellent podcast Darknet Diaries, hosted by Jack Rhysider, that Donald Trump’s LinkedIn password was exposed in a 2012 data breach. His password, `yourefired`, was his signature phrase from *The Apprentice*, the reality TV show he hosted. While he was running for president in 2016, three Dutch hackers, Victor, Edwin, and Matt, who are part of a group called the Guild of the Grumpy Old Hackers, discovered his LinkedIn password in the dataset from that breach. They tried it on Trump’s @realDonaldTrump Twitter account and … it worked.

You might be thinking, "Isn't using a password manager just putting all
my eggs in one basket? If it gets hacked, doesn't that give the hacker
access to *everything*?" This is true&mdash;it's very important to secure
your password manager&mdash;but not using one at all is like trying to hold
hundreds of eggs with just your hands, without using a basket, and
without breaking any of them. If you try that, you're bound to drop a
lot of your eggs eventually. You also always have the option of using
multiple password managers (multiple baskets) for different projects so
that if one gets hacked, the others remain secure.

There are several good password managers available, and if you already
know of one you like, by all means use it. Here are three that I
recommend:

**Bitwarden** This manager is free and open source, and it syncs
passwords between your computers and phone. It has browser extensions to
fill in passwords automatically when you log in to websites. It's a good
choice for a day-to-day password manager. Download it at
[https://bitwarden.com](https://bitwarden.com).

**1Password** Like Bitwarden, 1Password syncs passwords between your
computer and phone and has a browser extension. It's also a good choice
for a day-to-day password manager. It costs money, but 1Password gives
free licenses to journalists. Download it at
[https://1password.com](https://1password.com),
or see
[https://1password.com/for-journalism/](https://1password.com/for-journalism/)
for more information about the free license program.

**KeePassXC** This software is great for high-security situations.
Unlike Bitwarden and 1Password, KeePassXC doesn't sync your encrypted
password database to the cloud, which makes it less convenient but
potentially more secure. It works well on
air-gapped computers. Download it at
[https://keepassxc.org](https://keepassxc.org).

If you'd like to use Bitwarden, 1Password, or a similar password manager
that syncs between devices, follow the installation instructions on its
website to install the program on your computer, on your phone, and as
an extension in your web browser. If you're using a local-only password
manager like KeePassXC, just install it on your computer.

When you first set up your password manager, it's extremely important
that you not forget your master password. Unlike most website passwords,
a master password can't be reset. If you forget it, you're locked out of
your password manager forever and you lose all your passwords. Write the
master password on a piece of paper until you've memorized it, and then
destroy the paper.

The best master passwords are *passphrases*, a sequence of words picked
at random from a dictionary. They're also easier to remember than
completely random passwords. An example of a good passphrase is
*movie-flanked-census6-casino-change*. It has no meaning at all, but
with practice it's not too hard to memorize.

Once you've set up your password manager account, add your other
passwords to the manager. Start by adding the passwords you use the
most: perhaps your email password or passwords to social media accounts.
If you've ever reused these passwords, take this opportunity to *change
them* and make them better. Whenever you create a new password, use your
password manager's password generator, a tool included to help you
create strong passwords. Typically, password generators have settings
that let you choose whether it should generate a password or a
passphrase, whether it should contain numbers or special characters, how
long it should be, and so on.

Bitwarden, for example, can create both passwords or passphrases.
Figure 1-2 shows Bitwarden's password
generator, which is configured to create a passphrase with five words,
separated by dashes, capitalized, and including a number.

Bitwarden can also make strong passwords, such as *Frz6ioX4o@cCY*. All
of your passwords should either be strong passphrases or passwords like
this.

The password generators included in 1Password, KeePassXC, and other
password managers all include similar features. While Bitwarden allows
you to open the password generator tool independently, some password
managers require you to add a new item in your password database or edit
an existing one to access the generator.

When you need to come up with a new password, it doesn't matter if you
choose to use a password or a passphrase so long as it's strong and
unique. However, passphrases tend to be easier to memorize and to enter.
For this reason, I tend to use passwords to log in to websites (my
password manager fills them in for me) and passphrases for anything that
I might need to memorize or enter, such as a disk encryption passphrase
or the passphrase to log in to my computer.

Every time you create a new account or log in to an existing one, add
the password to your password manager.

### Disk Encryption

Disk encryption allows you to protect your data from people who have
physical access to your phone, laptop, or USB disk. It prevents anyone
from accessing data on a device if you lose it, someone steals it, it
gets confiscated at a border crossing or checkpoint, or your home or
office is raided. For example, when the internal disk in your laptop
isn't encrypted, anyone with physical access to it can unscrew your
laptop's case, remove the disk, and plug it into their own computer,
accessing all of the data without needing to know any of your passwords.
But when your disk is encrypted, all of this data is completely
inaccessible to anyone who doesn't have the right key. If disk
encryption is enabled, they'll need to first unlock the disk, typically
using a password, a PIN, or biometrics like a fingerprint or face scan.
You'll learn how to encrypt your internal disk and your 1TB USB disk in
this chapter's exercises.

Although disk encryption is an important part of protecting your data,
it doesn't protect against remote attacks. For example, if your laptop
is encrypted but someone tricks you into opening a malicious Word
document that attacks your computer, disk encryption won't stop them
from accessing your files. Disk encryption also won't help much if the
attackers get access to your device while it's unlocked&mdash;for example,
if you step away from your laptop at a coffee shop without locking your
screen or if attackers can easily unlock
your phone by forcing you to use biometrics. For instance, after
arresting you, a cop might wave your phone in front of your face to
unlock it with a face scan.

You, of course, won't be relying on disk encryption to commit crimes,
but the story of Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the darknet market
website Silk Road, is a good illustration of how it can fail you. In
2013, Ulbricht was using his encrypted laptop at the San Francisco
Public Library when two undercover FBI agents distracted him by
pretending to be lovers in a fight. Making sure his screen was unlocked,
they quickly arrested him, then copied important files off of his
computer. If his screen had been locked and he'd had a strong password,
the disk encryption might have prevented them from accessing his data at
all. Ulbricht was charged with money laundering, hacking, drug
trafficking, and other crimes.

Encrypting your laptop's internal disk is a basic security measure that
everyone should take. It's quick and easy to set up, doesn't require you
to do any extra work on a regular basis, and protects your privacy if
you lose your device. You can think of it like wearing a seatbelt:
there's really no good reason not to do it. Encrypting your laptop's
internal disk is especially important if you're going to be working with
sensitive data.



### Exercise 1-1: Encrypt Your Internal Disk

This exercise shows you how to encrypt the internal disk in your
computer, whether you have a Windows, Mac, or Linux machine. Skip to the
appropriate section for your operating system.


#### Windows

Different Windows versions and PC models have support for different
types of disk encryption. Pro editions of Windows include BitLocker,
Microsoft's disk encryption technology, and Home editions include device
encryption, which is basically BitLocker with limited features. These
features work only if your PC is new enough, though. If your computer
came with at least Windows 10 when it was new, it should support disk
encryption, but if it came with an earlier version of Windows, it might
not. I go over options for how to proceed in this case at the end of
this section.


##### BitLocker

To find out whether your computer includes BitLocker, click **Start**
(the Windows icon in the bottom left of your computer), search for
**bitlocker**, and open **Manage BitLocker**. If your version of Windows
supports it, the window should show whether BitLocker is enabled on your
*C:* system drive, and you should have the option to enable it. If so,
do that now.

When you enable BitLocker, it makes you save a recovery key to either
your Microsoft account, a file on a nonencrypted USB disk, or a printed
document. Saving your recovery key to your Microsoft account is the
simplest option, but it does mean that Microsoft or anyone with access
to your Microsoft account can access the key needed to unlock your disk.
If you'd prefer to not give Microsoft this access, print
the recovery key. You should also save your key in your password
manager. If your computer breaks, you'll need your recovery key to
access any of the data on your encrypted disk.



##### Device Encryption

If your version of Windows doesn't include BitLocker, try device
encryption. Click **Start**, then navigate to
**Settings** ▸ **Update & Security** (or **Privacy &
Security**, depending on your Windows version). Then go to the Device
encryption tab to check whether it's enabled; if not, enable it.

If you see no Device encryption tab, your PC doesn't support device
encryption, unfortunately. You have a few options. The easiest option is
to upgrade to the Pro version of Windows, which typically costs about
\$100, and then use BitLocker. Alternatively, use VeraCrypt.



##### VeraCrypt

VeraCrypt is free and open source disk encryption software. To begin,
download VeraCrypt from
[https://veracrypt.fr](https://veracrypt.fr),
install it on your computer, and open it.

Click **Create Volume** to open the VeraCrypt Volume Creation Wizard.
VeraCrypt lets you choose from three types of encrypted volumes. Select
**Encrypt the System Partition or Entire System Drive** and click
**Next**.

On the Type of System Encryption page, choose **Normal** and click
**Next**. On the Area to Encrypt page, choose **Encrypt the Windows
System Partition** and click **Next**. On the Number of Operating
Systems page, choose **Single-Boot** and click **Next** (unless you have
multiple operating systems on your computer, in which case choose
**Multi-boot**). On the Encryption Options page, use the default
settings and click **Next**.

The next page is the Password page. You'll need to come up with a strong
passphrase that you'll have to enter each time you boot up Windows. If
that passphrase is weak, your disk encryption will be weak. I recommend
generating a strong passphrase and saving it in your password
manager&mdash;this way, if you forget it the next time you reboot your
computer, you can look it up in your password manager on your phone.
Enter the passphrase twice and click **Next**.

The next page is called Collecting Random Data. VeraCrypt includes a
feature where you move your mouse around the window randomly so that it
can collect information from your mouse movements to make the encryption
more secure. Move your mouse around until the bar at the bottom of the
screen is green, and then click **Next**. Click **Next** again on the
Keys Generated page.

The Rescue Disk page prompts you to create a VeraCrypt Rescue Disk,
which you can use in the event that your disk gets damaged and you have
issues booting Windows. Creating a rescue disk is outside the scope of
this book, so check **Skip Rescue Disk Verification** and click
**Next**. On the Rescue Disk Created page, click **Next** again.

On the Wipe Mode page, select **None (Fastest)** as the Wipe mode and
click **Next**. On the System Encryption Pretest page, click **Test** to
test that disk encryption will work properly
on your computer&mdash;this will reboot your computer, and you'll need to
enter your VeraCrypt passphrase to boot up.

When you reboot your computer, it should boot up to the VeraCrypt
bootloader, and you'll need to enter the VeraCrypt passphrase to
proceed. Under PIM, just press **ENTER**. If all goes well, it
will succeed, Windows will boot up, and VeraCrypt will open on the
Pretest Completed page again after you log in. Click **Encrypt** to
begin encrypting your internal disk with VeraCrypt. From now on, you'll
need to enter your VeraCrypt passphrase each time you boot your
computer, but all of your data will also be protected with this
passphrase.




#### macOS

Apple's disk encryption technology is called FileVault. If you're using
macOS Ventura or newer, open the System Settings app, click **Privacy &
Security** on the left, and scroll down to the FileVault section. (If
you're using a version of macOS older than Ventura, open the System
Preferences app, click **Security & Privacy**, and make sure you're on
the FileVault tab.) If FileVault is turned off, turn it on.

The password that unlocks your Mac's disk is the password you use to log
in to your account. Make sure your Mac password is strong; if it's weak,
your disk encryption is weak.

When you enable FileVault, it makes you save a recovery key. Save that
key in your password manager. If you forget your Mac password, you'll
need the recovery key to access any of your data. If you're using a
local password manager that doesn't sync to the cloud, like KeePassXC,
store a copy of your recovery key somewhere else as well, such as on a
piece of paper kept in a secure location.



#### Linux

Linux uses technology called LUKS for disk encryption. You can check the
Disks program (in most versions of Linux, to open this program, press
the Windows key, type **disks**, and press **ENTER**) to see
whether your internal disk is encrypted. The program shows you all of
the disks attached to your computer and allows you to format them (see
Figure 1-3. If your internal disk has an
unlocked partition with LUKS encryption, disk encryption is enabled.

In this case, my internal disk is the 500GB Samsung SSD listed on the
left in Figure 1-3. My disk is partitioned
into four parts, and the last part (Partition 4) is 499GB and is
encrypted with LUKS. Your disk might look different from mine, but
you'll know it's encrypted if the main partition says LUKS.

Unfortunately, you can't just turn LUKS on or off. If your disk isn't
encrypted, the only way to encrypt it is to reinstall Linux, this time
making sure to encrypt the disk. When you're installing Linux, one of
the first steps in the installation process will be to partition your
disk; make sure to enable encryption during that step. If you're going
to reinstall Linux, always back up your data first. After choosing your
encryption passphrase, save a copy of it in your password manager;
you'll need it every time you boot up your computer.

![`Figure 1-3: Managing disks and partitions using Disks in Linux`](media/images/Figure1-3.png)  
*Figure 1-3: Managing disks and partitions using Disks in Linux*




### Exercise 1-2: Encrypt a USB Disk

Your internal disk alone likely isn't large enough to store all of the
datasets you'll need to work with. As mentioned in the book's
introduction, in order to complete the exercises in this book and work
with the massive datasets, you need a USB disk that's *at least 1TB*. To
encrypt that USB disk, you also need to format it, which deletes any
data already on it. This exercise shows you how to do that for whichever
operating system you're using.

Before you get started, let's go over some background on how mass
storage devices (like hard disks, SD cards, and so on) work. Storage
devices are typically split into one or more *partitions*, also called
*volumes*, with each partition using a format called a *filesystem*. You
can think of partitions as cabinets that use different shelving systems
(filesystems) to organize data. Different operating systems use
different filesystems. Windows often uses a filesystem called NTFS,
macOS often uses APFS, and Linux often uses ext4. There are also
filesystems that all three operating systems can use, such as ExFAT.

When you erase a storage device, you delete all of the partitions on it
so that it contains unallocated space. You can then create a new
partition&mdash;with USB disks, you'll typically create a single partition
that takes up all of the unallocated space&mdash;and format it using the
filesystem that matches your operating system.

Whether you're working in Windows, macOS, or Linux, begin by plugging
your USB disk into your computer. Open your password manager and save a
new strong passphrase, created using your password manager's password
generator. Name the password something like **datasets USB disk
encryption**.

To begin encrypting your disk, skip to the appropriate subsection for
your operating system.


#### Windows

Windows users with BitLocker should work through the following
subsection; if you don't have BitLocker, skip to the VeraCrypt section.


##### BitLocker

If you have a Windows computer with BitLocker, use that to encrypt your
USB. First, make sure to format the USB disk as NTFS. To do so, click
**Start**, search for **disk management**, and open **Create and Format
Hard Disk Partitions**. This opens the Windows Disk Management app, as
shown in Figure 1-4, which lists all of the
disks connected to the PC and lets you format them.

![`Figure 1-4: The Disk Management app in Windows`](media/images/Figure1-4.png)  
*Figure 1-4: The Disk Management app in Windows*

The bottom part of the window shows each disk attached to your computer
and how they're separated into partitions. Disk 0 is my internal hard
disk (as you can see, one of the partitions is *C:*), and Disk 1 is a
USB disk (one of those partitions is *D:*). On my computer, Disk 1 has a
single 32GB partition, as well as about 86GB of unallocated space.

Find the USB disk you need to format. Right-click on every partition and
choose **Delete Volume** until you've deleted all the partitions on the
disk. Then right-click on the unallocated space in your disk and choose
**New Simple Volume**, which should open a wizard to help you create the
volume. Choose the full amount of disk space and format it as NTFS. The
wizard will ask you for a *volume label*, which is just a name for your
partition; in Figure 1-4, the label for *D:*
is *data*. I recommend calling this disk *datasets*.

Once the disk is formatted, click **Start**,
search for **bitlocker**, and open **Manage BitLocker**. You should now
see your USB disk and have the option to turn on BitLocker. When you
enable BitLocker on your USB disk, a window should pop up asking how you
would like to unlock this drive. Choose **Use a Password to Unlock the
Drive**, then copy and paste your USB disk encryption passphrase from
your password manager into the password field. You'll need to paste it
into the field to re-enter the password as well. When you enable
BitLocker, you'll be required to save a recovery key to a file. Since
you're saving the passphrase in a password manager, however, you don't
need your recovery key, and you can delete the file.



##### VeraCrypt

If you use Windows Home and don't have BitLocker available on your
computer, use VeraCrypt to encrypt your USB disk.

If you don't already have VeraCrypt, download it from
[https://veracrypt.fr](https://veracrypt.fr),
install it on your computer, and open it. Click **Create Volume** to
open the VeraCrypt Volume Creation Wizard. On the first page of the
wizard, VeraCrypt lets you choose from three types of encrypted volumes.
Select **Encrypt a Non-system Partition/Drive** and click **Next**.

On the Volume Type page, VeraCrypt asks if you want a standard volume or
a hidden one. Select **Standard VeraCrypt Volume** and click **Next**.
On the Volume Location page, click **Select Device**, choose the USB
disk you want to encrypt, and click **Next**. On the Volume Creation
Mode page, select **Create Encrypted Volume and Format It** and click
**Next**. On the Encryption Options page, use the default settings and
click **Next**. You can't do anything on the Volume Size page, since
you're encrypting a whole partition rather than creating an encrypted
file container, so just click **Next**.

On the Volume Password page, copy and paste your USB disk encryption
passphrase from your password manager into the Password field, and paste
it again into the Confirm field. Then click **Next**. On the Large Files
page, VeraCrypt asks if you intend to store files larger than 4GB in
your VeraCrypt volume. Select **Yes** and click **Next**. On the Volume
Format page, under the Filesystem drop-down menu, select **exFAT** and
check the box next to **Quick Format**. VeraCrypt also includes a
feature where you move your mouse around the window randomly so that it
can collect information from your mouse movements to make the encryption
more secure. Move your mouse around until the bar at the bottom of the
screen is green, and then click **Format**.

A window should pop up, warning you that all of the data on your USB
disk will be erased and asking if you're sure you want to proceed. Click
**Yes**, and then wait while VeraCrypt creates an encrypted partition on
your USB disk. As long as you selected Quick Format on the previous
page, this should only take a few seconds. On the Volume Created page,
click **Exit** to exit the wizard and get back to the main VeraCrypt
window.

After you encrypt a USB disk with VeraCrypt, you need to use VeraCrypt
to *mount* it, or make it available on your computer as a drive letter.
In the main VeraCrypt window, select an available drive
letter (such as *F:*), click **Select Device**, select your
VeraCrypt-encrypted USB disk, and click **OK**, then **Mount**. After
you provide the encryption passphrase to unlock it, VeraCrypt will mount
your encrypted USB disk so you can use it. Now any files that you save
to this drive will be stored encrypted on disk.

Before unplugging your USB disk, unmount it by selecting the drive
letter in VeraCrypt and clicking **Dismount**.

**NOTE** *VeraCrypt also comes in handy if you need to access the same encrypted
disk across operating systems&mdash;for example, if you need to use it on
both a Windows PC and a Mac. However, for the purposes of this book,
only Windows users who don't have BitLocker should use VeraCrypt. In
general, you'll have fewer headaches if you stick with the disk
encryption software built into your operating system.*




#### macOS

Open the Disk Utility app, which you can find in the
*Applications/Utilities* folder. This app lists all of the disks
attached to your computer and lets you format them.

In Disk Utility, select the USB disk you plugged in and click the
**Erase** button. Name the disk *datasets* and choose **APFS
(Encrypted)** for format. You will then be prompted for the password to
unlock the encrypted disk. Copy and paste the USB disk encryption
passphrase that you created at the beginning of this exercise from your
password manager into Disk Utility. Disk Utility will also prompt you
for a password hint, but because you're saving this passphrase in your
password manager and not bothering to memorize it anyway, you can leave
the password hint blank.



#### Linux

Open the Disks app as you did in Exercise 1-1. Select your USB disk in
the list of disks on the left, then click the menu button and choose
**Format Disk**. This will delete all of the data on the USB.

Click the **+** button to add a new partition and set the
partition size to the largest option. Name your disk *datasets*, choose
**Internal Disk for Use with Linux Systems Only**, and check the box
**Password Protect Volume (LUKS)**. It will prompt you to enter a
password. Copy and paste the USB disk encryption passphrase that you
created at the beginning of this exercise from your password manager
into Disks.




### Protecting Yourself from Malicious Documents

Before you start working with any datasets on your encrypted USB disk,
you should know how to protect yourself from any potentially malicious
documents they may contain.

Have you ever been told to avoid opening email attachments from unknown
senders? This is solid computer security advice, but unfortunately
for researchers, journalists, activists, and
many other people, it's impossible to follow. In these lines of work,
it's often your *job* to open documents from strangers, including leaked
or hacked datasets.

Opening documents you don't trust is dangerous because it may allow
others to hack your computer. PDFs and Microsoft Office or LibreOffice
documents are incredibly complex. They can be made to automatically load
an image from a remote server, tracking when a document is opened and
from what IP address. They can contain JavaScript or macros that,
depending on how your software is configured, could automatically
execute code when opened, potentially taking over your computer. And
like all software, the programs you use to open documents, like
Microsoft Office and Adobe Reader, have bugs, which can sometimes be
exploited to take over your computer.

This is exactly what Russian military intelligence did during the 2016
US election, for example. First, the Main Directorate of the General
Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GRU) hacked a US
election vendor known as VR Systems and got its client list of election
workers in swing states. It then sent 122 email messages to VR Systems'
clients from the email address *vrelections@gmail.com*, with the
attachment *New EViD User Guides.docm*. If any of the election workers
who got this email opened the attachment using a vulnerable version of
Microsoft Word in Windows, the malware would have created a backdoor
into their computer for the Russian hackers. (We don't know for sure
whether any of the targets opened the malicious attachment.)

Sending malicious email to specific targets in this way as part of a
hacking operation is called *spearphishing*. Figure 1-5 shows a spearphishing email message
targeting an election worker in North Carolina, which The Intercept
obtained using a public records request.

In 2017, Reality Winner leaked a classified document describing this
spearphishing attack to The Intercept. Thanks to her whistleblowing, the
public knows considerably more about Russia's attacks on the US election
in 2016 than it otherwise would. In fact, US states like North Carolina
learned that they were under attack by Russian hackers only by *reading
The Intercept*. In 2022, two former election officials told *60 Minutes*
that Reality Winner's disclosure helped secure the 2018 midterm
elections against similar hacking attempts.

To make it safer to open untrusted documents, I developed an open source
app called Dangerzone. When you open an untrusted document in
Dangerzone, the app converts it into a *known-safe* PDF&mdash;one that you
can be confident is safe. Using technology called *Linux
containers*&mdash;which are like quick, small, self-contained Linux
computers running inside your normal computer&mdash;it converts the original
document into a PDF if it's not already one, splits the PDF into
different pages, and converts each page into raw pixel data. Then, in
another Linux container, it converts the pixel data back into a PDF. You
can also ask Dangerzone to use *optical character recognition (OCR)*
technology&mdash;software that looks at an image of text and figures out
what the characters are&mdash;to add a text layer back to the PDF so you can
still search the text.

*Figure 1-5: A spearphishing email targeting an election worker*

Dangerzone is essentially the digital equivalent of printing out a
document and rescanning it, stripping anything malicious from it, and
removing the original document's digital metadata. If you opened the
malicious *New EViD User Guides.docm* document using Dangerzone, it
would create a new document called *New EViD User Guides-safe.pdf*. You
could then safely open this PDF without risk. As an added benefit, you
don't need internet access to use Dangerzone, so it works well on
air-gapped computers.

You'll learn more about Dangerzone and Linux containers in Chapter 5,
which covers how to make datasets
searchable. In the meantime, Exercise 1-3 will show you how to get
started with it.



### Exercise 1-3: Install and Use Dangerzone

In this exercise, you'll install Dangerzone and use it to convert
documents into known-safe versions. Figure 1-6
shows a screenshot of Dangerzone in action&mdash;in this case, converting
the untrusted document *D&D 5e - Players Handbook.pdf* to a known-safe
version called *D&D 5e - Players Handbook-safe .pdf*, which is also
OCR'd and searchable.

Download and install Dangerzone from
[https://dangerzone.rocks](https://dangerzone.rocks).
The app relies on Linux containers. If you're working on a Windows or
macOS machine, the easiest way to get containers running is to use
software called Docker Desktop, which you'll be prompted to install the
first time you open Dangerzone. (You don't need to do anything with
Docker Desktop for now; simply install and open it. You'll learn more
about Docker in Chapter 5.)

Now that Dangerzone is installed, try it out. Open any PDF, Microsoft
Office document, LibreOffice document, or image on your computer in
Dangerzone and convert it to a safe PDF. If someone attaches a document
to an email and you don't trust it, download a copy of it first, open
Dangerzone, and click **Select Suspicious Documents**. Then browse for
the document you downloaded and use Dangerzone to convert it into a
known-safe version.

> #### VIRTUAL MACHINES
> 
Another option, which is a bit more complicated, is setting up a *virtual machine (VM)*. VMs are like a stronger version of Linux containers. They isolate the software running inside the VM more than Linux containers can, and they can run on any operating system. If you choose this option, make sure to disable internet access in your VM before opening documents. This way, if the document is malicious, it won’t let any attackers know the document was opened.
> 
> Giving detailed instructions on using VMs is outside the scope of this book. However, if you want to try them on your own, the easiest way to get started is to use the free and open source virtualization software VirtualBox ([https://www.virtualbox.org](https://www.virtualbox.org)). VirtualBox works for Intel-based Macs, Linux, and Windows computers. At the time of writing, there’s a beta version of VirtualBox that supports Apple Silicon Macs, but it has issues. If you have an Apple Silicon Mac, UTM ([https://mac.getutm.app](https://mac.getutm.app)) is a good choice. It’s free and open source, and you can find detailed instructions for installing different operating systems at [https://docs.getutm.app/guides/guides/](https://docs.getutm.app/guides/guides/). If you’d like something a bit easier, I recommend you try Parallels ([https://www.parallels.com](https://www.parallels.com)) or VMware Fusion ([https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html)) instead; note, however, that neither is free.

Dangerzone works great with PDFs and Word documents, but not so great
with spreadsheets. No matter what type of file you open in Dangerzone,
you always end up with a safe PDF, and spreadsheets really aren't meant
to be read in that format.

If Dangerzone doesn't do a good enough job with a document you'd like to
read, you can open it a few other ways while containing the damage. If
you don't believe the document is sensitive, upload it to Google Drive
and open it there, using Google's web interface. This way, technically
Google is opening the malicious document on its computers instead of you
opening it on yours.



### Summary

In this chapter, you've learned how to think about source protection in
today's world of widespread digital surveillance. You've also learned
about securely storing datasets, depending on their sensitivity;
verifying that your datasets are authentic; and redacting information
from documents before you publish your final report. You started using a
password manager to keep your passwords safe, and you encrypted your
internal disk and set up your encrypted *datasets* USB disk. Finally,
you practiced turning potentially malicious documents into ones you know
are safe to open using Dangerzone.

In the next chapter, you'll put your *datasets* disk to good use by
downloading your first hacked dataset.
